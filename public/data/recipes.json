    "content": "Source: https://www.loveandlemons.com/baked-potato/\n\nIngredients:\nPerfect Baked Potato\n\nA perfect baked potato has crispy skin and fluffy insides. My method for how to bake a potato works every time, so load up your spuds, and dig in!\n\nSIDE DISHES / VEGETARIAN \u2014 JUMP TO RECIPE\n\nA perfect baked potato is hard to beat. The outside is brown and crisp, coated in a crust of sea salt. Pierce the skin, and your fork gives way to a soft, fluffy interior. It might be hard to resist eating the whole thing straight out of the oven, but if you take the time to top it with a pat of butter or a dollop of (cashew) sour cream, you won\u2019t be able to deny that it was worth the wait.\n\nReading this, you might be surprised to learn that until recently, I wasn\u2019t a baked potato fan. I thought they were bland on their own. Whenever I had them at restaurants or at home as a kid, the toppings were always the main attraction. The potatoes themselves would be shriveled and soft, meager vessels for sour cream, cheddar cheese, and bacon.\n\nBut this salt-crusted baked potato recipe changed everything for me. In it, the potato becomes the main event. Don\u2019t get me wrong, a little butter or sour cream goes a long way here, but the potatoes come out of the oven with perfectly crispy, flavorful skins and creamy, piping hot interiors that taste delicious as they are. Serve them as a hearty side dish, or load them up and call them dinner. You\u2019ll love them either way!\n\nHow to Bake a Potato\n\nI like to use russet potatoes here, as their skin really puffs up and becomes crisp in the oven. Along with the potatoes, you\u2019ll just need olive oil and salt to make this baked potato recipe. Once you\u2019ve assembled your ingredients, follow these easy steps:\n\nFirst, preheat the oven to 425, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\nWhile the oven preheats, prep the potatoes. Scrub the potatoes well and pat them dry with a kitchen towel. Then, poke the potatoes with a fork a few times to create small holes across their surfaces.\n\nNext, season the potatoes.\u00a0Place them on the baking sheet and rub them all over with olive oil. Sprinkle them liberally with sea or kosher salt, and transfer them to the hot oven to bake.\n\nBake for 45 to 60 minutes, until the skins are crisp and puffy and you can easily pierce the potatoes with a fork. Use oven mitts to remove the hot baking sheet from the oven.\n\nFinally, dig in!\u00a0Allow the potatoes cool for a few minutes before slicing them open, fluffing up their insides, and topping them with your favorite fixings. I like cashew sour cream, tempeh bacon, chives, and salt and pepper!\n\nBaked Potato Recipe Tips\nSkip the foil!\u00a0The key to making a good baked potato is getting really crispy skin. If you wrap the potatoes in foil, the potato skins will shrivel and soften in the oven. For the best results, leave the potatoes unwrapped.\nDon\u2019t skimp on the salt. Are you someone who likes to eat potato skins? If you make this baked potato recipe, you will be! Coating the spuds in salt makes the skins extra-crispy and flavorful. Plus, with a bit of the salty skin in each bite, you won\u2019t need to worry about seasoning the potato flesh as you eat.\nKnow that the cooking time will vary.\u00a0In the recipe below, I say to bake your potatoes for 45 to 60 minutes. This is a wide range, but I list it for a reason. The cooking time will vary depending on the size of the potatoes. Be ready to take them out of the oven when they\u2019re fork-tender and their skin is crisp. The baking time will be longer for larger potatoes and shorter for small ones.\n\nOven Baked Potato Serving Suggestions\n\nYou can\u2019t go wrong by serving this oven baked potato recipe with a pat of butter, salt, and pepper, but a few well-chosen toppings can really take it to the next level. I love mine with cashew sour cream, tempeh bacon, and chives, but regular sour cream, \u201ccheese sauce,\u201d Greek yogurt, or cheddar cheese would also be delicious.\n\nEnjoy this baked potato recipe as a meal on its own, or pair it with your favorite protein. It would also be yummy with a hearty salad like my Caesar salad, broccoli salad, or kale salad, or with roasted broccoli, cauliflower, or Brussels sprouts.\n\nMore Favorite Potato Recipes\n\nIf you loved learning how to bake a potato, try one of these favorite potato recipes next!\n\nRoasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes\nCreamy Potato Soup\nBaked Sweet Potato\nCrispy Baked Sweet Potato Fries\nOven Roasted Potatoes\n\nGet This Recipe In Your Inbox\nShare your email, and we'll send it straight to your inbox.

If you\u2019ve never tried sun-dried tomatoes, prepare to be amazed! You can easily find them at your local grocery store, typically located near the olives. Trust me, they\u2019re a game-changer!\nMinimal Cleanup:\u00a0I\u2019m all about keeping things simple, and this shrimp pasta does just that. With only two pans in play, not only do you get a comforting meal, but cleanup is a breeze.\nShrimp:\u00a0The juicy shrimp, with their natural sweetness and seafood essence, pairs perfectly with the rich sun-dried tomato cream sauce. This combination creates a burst of flavors that tantalizes the taste buds. I always keep a bag of frozen shrimp in my freezer. It means you can thaw them whenever you\u2019re ready to cook.\nPantry Magic:\u00a0With basic seasonings, pasta, cream, a bit of butter, garlic cloves, and Parmesan from your pantry and fridge, you\u2019ve got all it takes to create a simple yet irresistible dish that will become a regular in your rotation.\nSuper Versatile:\u00a0Want to save yourself from a trip to the store?

Enjoy the recipe!\n\nReply\nMelissa Kreisler\n21.07.2024\n\nCouple of adjustments that I made; don\u2019t use the flour, add pasta water instead. Pasta water already has starch in it, which acts as a thickener. Also, instead of using all the broth, use part of it and sub white wine. It added a lovely addition to the taste! I used calamarata (or pacchiere, it\u2019s also called) pasta.\n\nReply\nAnna Chwistek\n21.07.2024\n\nThanks so much for commenting and for the tips Melissa!\n\nReply\nAnna Chwistek\n21.07.2024\n\nThanks so much for commenting and for the tips Melissa!\n\nReply\nJane\n3.09.2024\n\nCould you do the sauce and shrimp ahead of time \u2013 hour or so \u2013 then combine all with the rigatoni and heat?

Heat a large dutch oven over medium high heat. Sear the short ribs in batches, adding vegetable oil as needed. Set aside.\nPour off excess fat, leaving about 1-2 tbsp. Add the chopped vegetables and a pinch of salt and begin scraping up any browned beef bits off the bottom of the pot. Cook until vegetables start to soften, about 5-10 minutes.\nAdd the tomato paste and stir to evenly distribute. Continue to cook until the tomato paste has started to caramelize and stick to the pot, about 3 minutes.\nDeglaze with red wine and scrape the bottom of the pot. Reduce the wine about \u2154 in volume. Stir in beef stock and return short ribs to the pot. The liquid should almost cover the short ribs completely, so add more stock or water if needed. Add thyme sprigs, a few sprigs of parsley and a bay leaf.\nBring everything to a boil, cover tightly with a lid, and transfer to your preheated oven for 4 hours.\nWhen the short ribs are done cooking, remove them from the pot and set aside. Strain the braising liquid and discard the solids. Return the strained liquid to the pot and reduce by half. Taste and adjust seasoning. Optional: for a silkier sauce, whisk in a few tbsp of cold butter.\nTo serve, ladle sauce over short ribs and top with fresh chopped parsley and lemon zest."

Just gently bring it together, fold it out once or twice, and then cut straight down with your biscuit cutter \u2013 AS IF! More like the rim of a drinking glass. If you own a biscuit cutter you are light years ahead of me.\nINSTRUCTIONS\nVIDEO On Off\nBiscuits: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together. Grate butter and work it into the dry mix with your hands. Add milk and stir gently with a fork to bring it all together. Turn dough out onto a clean counter. Fold it over a few times to get it into a 1-2 inch thick layer. Roll into a flat little block and cut 6-8 biscuits from it using a biscuit cutter, rim of a drinking glass, or\u2026 just a knife. Let\u2019s not be too precious here.\n\nFilling: Melt the butter in a large oven-safe Dutch oven or pan. Add the shallots, garlic, and thyme; saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, and 1 teaspoon of salt; saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes. Add the flour; let it cook for 1-2 minutes. Add wine; let it sizzle out. The mixture will be sticky and thick. Don\u2019t panic. You\u2019re doing it right. Slowly and gradually, add the chicken broth, milk, and cream. Stir and let it rest a bit after each addition. After a few minutes the mixture should resemble a thick, creamy soup. Add chicken and peas. Season to taste with remaining salt, pepper, and just a tiny bit of lemon juice. Remove sprigs of thyme.\n\nBake: Arrange biscuits on top of filling. Brush biscuits with milk or butter for extra browning. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until hot, bubbly, and biscuits are cooked through. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving and season with salt and pepper to taste! YUM.\nINSTRUCTIONS\nVIDEO On Off\nBiscuits: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Bonus points to me if I\u2019ve managed to freeze it in advance.\n\nBut I definitely have a plain round biscuit cutter. The sharp edges mean the layers don\u2019t smoosh and stick together like when a drinking glass edge presses them down, meaning the flaky layers are able to separate more at the edges and allow the biscuit to rise more fully in the oven.\n\nIt might be a small thing (biscuits cut with a mason jar do have a certain charm), but I\u2019ve gotten a bit intense about my biscuits haha!\n\nMy MIL swaps the salt for roasted garlic seasoning and basil, adds cheddar, and rolls them out with icing sugar instead of flour (just like her scones). They\u2019re addictive in a sweet/savoury way!\n\n11/13/19 @ 1:11 AM\nREPLY\nELLEN\n\nHi! I am loving your recipes and want to make this Chicken Pot Pie with biscuits.

Walk me through please so I double all amounts of ingredients do I also double the time and add 10 min more or is it 40 min total? If I want to make a day ahead of time, I would still add everything except extra crispy onions on the top right? Cheese is ok to add in the sauce too?\n\nReply\nSpend With Pennies CG\nDecember 23, 2024 at 6:46 am\n\nHi Teri, to double this recipe I would suggest a 9\u00d713 pan and increasing the baking time by about 15 minutes.

This was a total hit. I used Holly\u2019s recipe exactly as listed: with her recipe link for the \u201ccreamed mushrooms\u201d (with fresh mushroom saut\u00e9..) instead of the can of cream of mushroom soup AND I added the cheese (optional). At dinner, it got positive comments, \u201cOh my, who made the green beans? \u2026 they are so good\u201d. But when it came time to request \u201cleftovers\u201d to take home, EVERYONE wanted to take some home. YES! Another GREAT recipe from Holly! Highly recommend!\n\nReply\nML\nNovember 28, 2024 at 7:05 pm\n\nI made a double recipe for Friendsgiving and there are NO leftovers. I made it vegan with unsweetened soy milk in place of dairy milk, & used the vegan condensed mushroom soup recipe from It Doesn\u2019t Taste Like Chicken. it was perfect. second year I\u2019ve made this for thanksgiving and I think I\u2019ll make it always. thank you!!!\n\nReply\nLauren\nNovember 28, 2024 at 12:22 pm\n\nThank you for your easy to follow recipe! I am also enjoying reading your replies to other reviews lol happy Thanksgiving!\n\nReply\nTara Andrews\nNovember 28, 2024 at 9:48 am\n\nWhat should I do if I want to use a regular (non-condensed) cream of chicken soup instead of the condensed cream of mushroom soup?\n\nReply\nHolly Nilsson\nNovember 28, 2024 at 9:57 am\n\nThe consistency is different, it will be quite runny.\n\nWhile I can\u2019t say for sure how it would work since I haven\u2019t tried it, you can try thickening the soup. Bring 10.5 oz soup to a low bowl. Combine 1 tablespoon cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water. Drizzle it into the boiling soup while whisking to thicken, you may not need all of the cornstarch mixture.\n\nAnother option would be to make homemade condensed chicken soup.\n\nReply\nHolly Nilsson\nNovember 28, 2024 at 9:57 am\n\nThe consistency is different, it will be quite runny.\n\nWhile I can\u2019t say for sure how it would work since I haven\u2019t tried it, you can try thickening the soup.

Once melted, continue cooking the butter until the bits at the bottom of the pan are golden brown and the butter has a nutty aroma. This should take about 7-8 minutes.\n\nPour into a glass bowl and place into the freezer. Stir every 5 minutes until the butter reaches a spreadable consistency similar to softened butter.\n\nIn the bowl of your stand mixer, cream the cooled spreadable browned butter with the sugars until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.

The edges should be just set, but the cookies should still look slightly wet in the center.\n\nRemove the cookies from the oven and bang the cookie sheet on the counter 2-3 times to help them spread. Then, use a spoon or small rubber spatula to scoot any runaway edges back into place. Sprinkle with a little extra cinnamon sugar.\n\nFor the Cream Cheese Glaze\n\nIn a medium mixing bowl, whisk the softened butter and cream cheese until smooth. Add the vanilla bean paste (or vanilla extract) until combined.\n\nThen, whisk in the powdered sugar. If needed, use milk or heavy cream to thin it out if needed.\n\nDrizzle the cream cheese icing onto the cooled cookies and enjoy.\nINSTRUCTIONS\nFor the Cookies\n\nIn a medium saucepan, add the butter and melt over medium heat.

I did not have the time or energy to make the dressing, so I used a store bought Caesar dressing. This was a really satisfying meal.

This was my first time using the Dutch oven. And wow, this recipe/method is the best! I halved the recipe and it was perfect for two people. For those who are asking, cooking time for 1.5 lbs roast was the same. I like mine super tender, so I did 2 hrs for roast then another 2 hrs for vegetables. I used russet potatoes cut in thick chunks, and regular carrots also thickly cut. Didn\u2019t have fresh herbs, so I used 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning. Didn\u2019t use wine. Doubled Worcestershire sauce. Hope this helps someone.\n\nReply\nStephanie says\n\nMarch 14, 2025 at 4:47 pm\n\nThis was amazing!! So much flavor and really easy! I did make a couple additions to sweeten the flavors. First I added cremini mushrooms along with the onions \u2013 caramelizing them together and then added the tomato paste same time as the garlic to really heighten the tomatoes flavor. With the liquids I added 2 TBS of molasses \u2013 this provided a sweeter flavor and opted for beef broth and no red wine. Instead of white potatoes I used diced sweet potatoes. I also included more carrots. My husband loved all the vegetables. It was incredibly tender! Thanks for such a great recipe. I look forward to trying others!!\n\nReply\nJessica says\n\nMarch 10, 2025 at 9:44 pm\n\nHello!\n\nI only have a 4.5 qt pot so I had to cut the recipe in half.\nWhen doing this, does the cook time go down by half as well?\n\nReply\n\nTania says\n\nMarch 10, 2025 at 10:01 pm\n\nHi!

drained (see note 3)\n\u25a2\n2 cups shredded cheddar cheese shredded\nFor assembling the bowls:\n\u25a2\n1 (15 ounce) can black beans rinsed and drained (see note 3)\n\u25a2\n2 cups shredded cheddar cheese shredded\n\u25a2\n1 (15 ounce) can black beans rinsed and drained (see note 3)\n1\n(15 ounce) can\nblack beans\nblack beans\nrinsed and drained (see note 3)\n\u25a2\n2 cups shredded cheddar cheese shredded\n2\ncups\nshredded cheddar cheese\nshredded cheddar cheese\nshredded\n\nInstructions:\nMake the marinade in a food processor by blending together the red onion, garlic, adobo sauce, ancho chili powder, olive oil, cumin, and oregano.\u00a0 Add a little water to the marinade, then pour it into a zipper-top plastic bag with the boneless chicken thighs. (Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are okay, too.) Let marinate for 30 minutes or up to overnight.\nWhen ready, cook the chicken in a skillet over medium-high heat, using a little olive oil. Sear the chicken on one side, then the other, until it registers an internal temperature of 165 degrees. Take the chicken out of the pan and chop into bite-sized pieces.\nCook the basmati rice in a pot of water, using a 4:1 water to rice ratio. Bring the water to a boil, then add the rice, a little salt, and a bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then cook for 10 to 12 minutes until tender.\nDrain off the excess water, rinse the rice with hot water in a fine-mesh sieve, and dump the rice in a bowl. Stir in the lemon and lime juices, and the chopped cilantro, then season with salt.\nFrozen corn works great here, so cook it using the package\u2019s instructions, then spread it out on a baking sheet to let it cool.\nThen toss it together with the chopped roasted poblano pepper, red onion, cilantro, lemon juice, lime juice, and chopped jalape\u00f1o peppers. Give it a little bit of salt, too.\nThe best for last! Plan on about \u00bd avocado for each person. Scoop out the flesh of the avocados, and mash it together with the lemon and lime juice.\nThen stir in the chopped onion, cilantro, jalape\u00f1o, and a pinch of salt.\nTo build the bowl, just set everything out and pretend you\u2019re at the Chipotle counter. Grab your biggest bowl.\nStart with the rice, then the beans, then the chicken. A little salsa, some corn, then a whole lotta guac. (No upcharge here!)\nAdd some cheese, lettuce, and all that\u2019s left to do is grab a fork and enjoy all your (not so) hard work.\nAdobo sauce: You can drain off some adobo sauce from those small cans of Chipotle peppers in adobo, or you can purchase a jar of just adobo paste (La Coste\u00f1a makes one). To make adobo sauce, mix together about 3 parts adobo paste + 1 part water.\nOregano: You can use either Italian or Mexican oregano if you\u2019re lucky to find it. They have slightly different flavors (Mexican oregano tastes more like marjoram) but both taste great in this recipe. Feel free to use whatever you have.\nCanned black beans: Canned black beans are the biggest shortcut here, but you can definitely make your own Chipotle black beans (or pinto beans) if you have time.\nYield: The recipe card below is scaled down to make enough for 4 bowls.\nMake ahead: Marinate the chicken the night before. Chop up the pico de gallo the day before you plan to eat. Try making slow cooker black beans so they\u2019re ready by the time you\u2019re hungry.\nLeftovers: Save the leftovers for more bowls, or make a sheet tray of nachos in the oven and dig in.\nPick out some other Chipotle recipes:\u00a0Maybe next time, you want to switch it up? No problem. All the Chipotle recipes are here so you can make them at home."

I can't say what the reason was but this recipe was really perfection! The first batch I'd given away to my sister at her workplace, minus one ( due to taste test) got rave reviews on them! Second batch we got to eat half and gave the other half to my mom after I raved about the first batch. Besides she'd given me a surplus of bananas to bake bread. So I made one more batch with the last of the blueberries I had and they look so scrumptious! I'm sure these will be gone in a outlet days. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe! I made no substitutions...\nSee More \u00a0\nJSAV1218\nREPLY\n7\nI made 3 batches of these. Turned out amazing. I did tweek it a little. I used brown sugar instead of white and I added 2 tsp of cinnamon and 2 tsp of vanilla/almond. I tested this with a different cooking method I had and zapped them at 450 for 5 minutes before cooking for 15 min at the 375. It is supposed to help the tops rise more and it worked. I also subbed for strawberries in one batch and did a strawberry blueberry in another. I will make these again\nSee More \u00a0\nNYLANDER652\nREPLY\n5\nCan I say more that fabulous? These were made for my dairy-allergic son (with a substitution of vegetable oil minus a tsp. from the measurement instead of the butter) and he gobbled them up. It has been hard finding recipes that interest a 2 year old but this one is a keeper! (Mommy and Daddy loved them too!!!) Only other change I made was to substitute brown sugar for white and added a little crumbled brown sugar to the tops before baking which added a little more sweetness. Loved it...LOVED it...LOVED IT!!!\nSee More \u00a0\nALAPEANUTBUTTERSAND\nREPLY\n4\nThese came out great. I used 2 bananas and subbed 1/2 c. shredded carrot for the third banana because I don't like an overly strong banana flavor. I subbed brown sugar for regular sugar. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 c. chopped walnuts. I sprinkled sugar on top before putting them in the oven. The cinnamon was a little too much so I will reduce the cinnamon to just 1/4 tsp the next time or eliminate the cinnamon altogether. I will also try 1 1/3 c. blueberries instead of just 1 cup next time. Both my husband and I felt that more blueberries would have make these better.

My husband said it was the best fish dish I have ever made. I made 2 portions in individual bakers and skipped the olives in his. I forgot the butter, but I don\u2019t think I really missed it (I did drizzle a healthy dose of olive oil over everything before baking). I was going to add some spinach toward the end of baking but forgot that also. Added chopped fresh basil before serving. I served with bread since we aren\u2019t a huge rice family, and we soaked up every bit of the juices with it.\n\nReply"

Once the beef is cooked, you want to cook it with the seasoning and liquid on medium low and just until the sauce starts to thicken. Keep an eye on it so it doesn\u2019t dry out.\nHeat up the tortillas before adding the ground beef on top. You can heat them up in the microwave, oven or on a skillet for 1-2 minutes per side. This makes the tortillas soft, pliable and much less likely to break.\nAdd onions to the mixture to make it more savory. You\u2019ll want to cook the onions until they soften before adding the ground beef. It gives the taco meat a deeper flavor, but it\u2019s totally optional. Adding onion powder is a quick easy update as well.\nINSTRUCTIONS\nHeat the olive oil in skillet over medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until browned, about 5-7 minutes.

Then these pulled pork sliders are perfect!\n\nLet\u2019s face it: after a long day of hiking, swimming, or just lounging around the campsite, you want a meal that\u2019s satisfying and easy to put together. This pulled pork slider recipe fits the bill perfectly!\n\nQuick & Easy Camping Meals\n\nSave time at the campsite and get our best menu ideas for your next campout (without the fuss)!\n\nSend it to me!\n\nWith the pulled pork made ahead of time using our handy Instant Pot Pulled Pork recipe and our mostly make-ahead coleslaw recipe, the only thing you\u2019ll have to do at the campsite is reheat the pulled pork and assemble the sliders.\u00a0\n\nSounds simple enough, right? Trust us, it is!\n\nBelow, we share our tips for prepping these sliders, storing the pulled pork and coleslaw for your trip. With the heavy lifting done at home, assembling these juicy sliders at the campsite is a cinch!\n\nIngredients\n\nPulled BBQ pork: Made from shredded pork shoulder (a.k.a. pork butt) that\u2019s been cooked with bbq sauce, apple cider vinegar, and spices until it\u2019s falling apart.\u00a0\n\nYou can use our Instant Pot Pulled Pork recipe \u2013it\u2019s quick and easy to make and will leave you with plenty of leftovers to work with. Or you can use store-bought precooked shredded pork and add your own BBQ sauce to it.\u00a0\n\nSlider rolls: Regular dinner rolls, brioche buns, or Hawaiian buns\u00a0for an extra touch of sweetness. Use a serrated knife to slice the rolls in half, and, if possible, toast the insides of the top and bottoms.\u00a0\n\nBarbecue sauce: Use your favorite BBQ sauce (we personally love Carolina Gold for pulled pork sandwiches).\n\nColeslaw: Make our creamy, tangy, homemade coleslaw or you can use storebought to serve with the sliders.\u00a0\n\nYour favorite toppings: Pickles, pickled jalapenos, thinly sliced onion, avocado, mozzarella cheese or pepper jack cheese, cilantro, etc.\n\nMake-Ahead BBQ Pulled Pork\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019re planning on making these sliders for a camping trip, we HIGHLY recommend making the pulled pork ahead of time at home or using leftover pulled pork. Not only does it save you a ton of time and on-site cleanup, but the pork actually tastes better the next day (or the day after that!) when properly stored in a refrigerator or cooler.\u00a0\n\nTo make the pulled pork at home, we use our Instant Pot Pulled Pork recipe. Unlike using a smoker or slow cooker, the pressure cooking function of the Instant Pot speeds the whole process up and reduces active cooking time. So it\u2019s easy enough to throw together even on a busy weekday night before your camping trip.\n\nBut, if you\u2019re on a time crunch, you can purchase pre-cooked, sauceless pulled pork from the grocery store, and then add either store-bought or homemade bbq sauce.\u00a0\n\nCrunchy, Tangy, Mostly Make-Ahead\u00a0Coleslaw \u00a0\n\nWhile there are lots of optional toppings for sliders, we consider coleslaw to be semi-mandatory. A crunchy slaw pairs perfectly with the richness of the pork, offering a perfect balance of flavors and textures with each bite. It\u2019s just wonderful!\u00a0\n\nWe like the cabbage in our\u00a0coleslaw to be slightly softened but retain most of its crunch. It doesn\u2019t take long for the salt and vinegar to start breaking down the cabbage, so it can be tricky to be fully made ahead of time.\n\nSo we developed our own mostly-made-ahead coleslaw recipe that we tailored especially for camping.\u00a0\n\nAt home, thinly slice all the cabbage, grate the carrots and chop up the herbs. Add all the vegetables to a gallon zip-top baggie and add them to your cooler.\u00a0\n\nSeparately, mix together all the ingredients for the dressing into a resealable container like a mason jar and pack it along in your cooler.\u00a0\n\nAt camp, when you\u2019re about 1-2 hours away from mealtime, add the dressing to the zip-top baggie with all the vegetables. Massage the bag with your hands until all the vegetables are well coated. Return to the cooler until ready to serve.\u00a0\n\nYou can get all the details for our easy make-ahead creamy coleslaw here.\n\nHow To Make Pulled Pork Sliders At Camp!\u00a0\n\nThe sequence for making pulled pork sliders at a campsite is fairly straightforward, but seeing it broken out into the main steps can be helpful:\n\nAdd dressing to coleslaw mix (1-2 hours before meal time)\u00a0\nReheat the pulled pork (in a sauce pot)\u00a0\nToast buns (in a skillet) \u2014 optional!\nAssemble,\u00a0 add sauce and toppings, and serve!\nTopping Options\n\nThere are a ton of different options for topping pork sliders but here are a few ideas to riff off of:\n\nColeslaw\u00a0\nPickles\u00a0\nPickled jalapenos or pepperoncini\nThinly sliced onion\nAvocado\nMozzarella cheese or pepper jack cheese\nCilantro\nPork Rinds or potato chips (for crunch)\u00a0\nServe This With\u2026\n\nNeed some side dishes for pulled pork to serve with your sliders?

Balances easy, delicious and quick. Some casserole recipes use eggs or other ingredients, this didn\u2019t need it. I like my casserole a little chunky so I didn\u2019t mash it super fine.

So many recipes call for a ton of sugar and it's too sweet. I usually do marshmallows in the center and then surround them with the streusel so that folks can get the style they want. One sister can't eat nuts due to diverticulitis so it gives her an option and yet those of us who prefer the streusel can still have it. I usually get a bit of both in my scoop. ;-)\n\nReply\n\nRhonda says\n\nDecember 07, 2020 at 4:13 am\n\nWhat size dish is 20 ounces in inches\n\nReply\nRhonda says\n\nDecember 07, 2020 at 4:13 am\n\nWhat size dish is 20 ounces in inches\n\nReply\nMelissa says\n\nNovember 21, 2018 at 6:49 am\n\nIf I were to double this recipe and cook it in a metal/foil (throw away dish), do you think it would need to cooked in the oven longer?\n\nReply\n\nChristina Lane says\n\nNovember 21, 2018 at 7:14 am\n\nGreat question!

I decided to also add 3 tablespoons of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt, but it\u2019s optional. (I always think recipes could use a little more salt and sugar, what can I say.)\nI added 2 eggs to the pan on the right, to test which kind I like better. And last but not least, add in your Jiffy cornbread mix! Stir it all together right there in the pan. That\u2019s really it. So easy.\nFor the recipe with eggs, I reserved half of the sour cream and swirled it on the top. A few recipes said this was their secret to the dreamiest creamiest corn casserole! (I actually wasn\u2019t impressed with this method.)\nInstructions\nPreheat your oven to 350 degrees F.\nIn a 8\u00d78 or 9\u00d79 inch glass pan, add 1/2 cup butter. Put it in the microwave and melt it right in the pan. (If you only have a metal pan, melt it in a bowl and then transfer to the pan.*) Use a spatula or pastry brush to spread the butter up the sides of the pan, so that it doesn't stick while baking.\nOpen the can of whole corn kernels and drain. I usually just press the lid down on the corn holding it upside down over the sink. Add the drained corn to the butter in the pan.\nOpen the can of creamed corn and dump the whole thing into the pan.\nAdd 1 cup sour cream.\nAdd 3 tablespoons sugar and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (add 1/4 teaspoon if using table salt).\nAdd an 8 ounce box of Jiffy corn muffin mix.\nUse a spatula to stir it all together until well combined. Scrape down the edges.\nBake at 350 for about 35-40 minutes. The edges should be turning golden brown and pulling away from the sides. When you shake the pan, the center should not be jiggling more than the edges. You can also use the toothpick test, when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with no wet batter, it\u2019s done.\nLet cool on a wire rack for a couple minutes before serving warm!\nVariations\nSweet Corn Casserole: Add 1/2 cup or even 3/4 cup sugar instead of 3 tablespoons\nFor a cake-like texture, rather than custard texture: add 2 eggs. This makes the casserole a little more fluffy and taller. This is a VERY common addition to corn casserole, but I prefer it without the eggs. It\u2019s good both ways though!\nAdd cheese: how can you go wrong? Omit the 3 tablespoons sugar and stir in 1 and 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese. Sprinkle another 1/2 cup cheese on top. You could even go wild and add in some chopped jalapanos\u2026or some cooked bacon!\nMake it in the slow cooker: You can make this recipe as written in a 4-quart slow cooker, or double the recipe and make it in a 6 quart slow cooker. Be sure to spray the edges. Cook on high for 2 hours, or low for 3-4 hours. Super handy for Thanksgiving when you need your oven for the turkey!\nTo make the second version I tried that you see in the photos: Follow the recipe as directed making these changes: reserve half of the sour cream. Add 2 eggs. Mix it all together, then dollop the remaining 1/2 cup sour cream on top and swirl in with a knife.

This makes the casserole a little more fluffy and taller. This is a VERY common addition to corn casserole, but I prefer it without the eggs. It\u2019s good both ways though!\nAdd cheese: how can you go wrong? Omit the 3 tablespoons sugar and stir in 1 and 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese. Sprinkle another 1/2 cup cheese on top. You could even go wild and add in some chopped jalapanos\u2026or some cooked bacon!\nMake it in the slow cooker: You can make this recipe as written in a 4-quart slow cooker, or double the recipe and make it in a 6 quart slow cooker. Be sure to spray the edges. Cook on high for 2 hours, or low for 3-4 hours. Super handy for Thanksgiving when you need your oven for the turkey!\nTo make the second version I tried that you see in the photos: Follow the recipe as directed making these changes: reserve half of the sour cream.

I only used half a stick of butter. I omitted the salt entirely, and I added two eggs. I also mixed all the ingredients together in a mixing bowl, including half the melted butter. I baked it in a glass 2 quart round casserole dish. I did have to bake it for over an hour, as the middle wasn\u2019t setting up very fast. I could have probably put it into a 9\u00d713 glass dish and baked it for the recommended 35-40 minutes. At any rate, it turned out great. Thank you for sharing this delightful recipe.\n\nREPLY\nKIM MATTHEWS\nJanuary 28, 2025 at 6:11 pm\n\nTry mixing the casserole in a bowl, and putting a good layer of chili in the baking dish before covering it with the casserole mixture. Bake it as the recipe says. I\u2019ve done this with Jiffy cornbread mix for decades, and it comes out super delicious. Using the cornbread casserole on top of the chili would be awesome.\n\nREPLY\nTHE FOOD CHARLATAN\nJanuary 28, 2025 at 8:04 pm\n\nThis is mindblowing Kim!! what a fun idea, thanks for sharing!!\n\nREPLY\nTHE FOOD CHARLATAN\nJanuary 28, 2025 at 8:04 pm\n\nThis is mindblowing Kim!! what a fun idea, thanks for sharing!!\n\nREPLY"

Our family/friends loved it! Since then I\u2019ve made the recipe and it\u2019s not the same. The texture is thick and gummy and not cake-like. I did swirl it with a toothpick and then remembered it had to be swirled with a pairing-knife. I also baked it for 20 extra minutes because it wouldn\u2019t come out with a clean knife. What am I doing wrong? Maybe I over-swirled?\n\nREPLY\nTieghan\nJanuary 6, 2025 at 3:28 AM\n\nHi Nicole,\nSo glad to hear you have enjoyed this recipe! Hmmm, I don\u2019t think the swirl would give this a gummy texture. Are you doing anything else differently? Different baking dish or anything like that? xx\n\nREPLY\nNicole\nJanuary 7, 2025 at 7:30 PM\n\nI used a loaf pan both times- I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the same one I used the first time I made it. I know it says to mix until just combined. I used a stand mixer \u2013 is it possible I over mixed and should maybe just mix the flour in by hand?\n\nREPLY\nTieghan\nJanuary 8, 2025 at 1:38 PM\n\nOhhh yes!

I think I used it in the gooey chocolate chip cookie pie thing which got devoured at our family\u2019s early Thanksgiving.\n\nAnyway, the extra pumpkin butter has been taunting me from the fridge, so I decided to make this tonight since I had all of the ingredients on hand. It\u2019s freaking delicious and I didn\u2019t even need to use my mixer. I made one tweak to add some protein by using two scoops of Vital Proteins Collagen into the cinnamon swirl instead of the flour. At least it\u2019s a little something in addition to the pumpkin fiber and all the benefits of cinnamon. Gotta get it in where you can during the holidays! Thanks so much for creating another winner Tieghan. \ud83d\udc95 I\u2019ll definitely make this again and even gift it. \ud83d\ude18\n\nREPLY\nTieghan\nDecember 7, 2024 at 7:03 AM\n\nHey Ashley,\nFantastic!!

This is one I will make on repeat; moist and sweet, but not too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly. I did reduce the butter in the crumble to 1/4 cup after reading reviews. I did not add the drizzle as I wanted to taste for sweetness first and to me was just right. I also used Trader Joe\u2019s pumpkin butter. Truly a perfect recipe!\n\nREPLY\nTieghan\nOctober 29, 2024 at 11:06 AM\n\nWow, thank you so much, Laurie:) I am so glad to hear this recipe turned out nicely for you, I appreciate you making it!

Even 30 more minutes in the crockpot can make the world of difference between an \u201cokay\u201d beef and melt-in-your-mouth\u00a0beef.\nCool:\u00a0Allow Crockpot Beef Stew to cool completely before freezing to preserve the integrity of the ingredients.\nPackage:\u00a0 Transfer soup to an airtight freezer safe container or freezer bag.\u00a0 You can even use sandwich size plastic bags for individual stew portions.\u00a0 Squeeze out any excess air to prevent freezer burn and label\nFreeze. Freeze for up to 3 months.\nDefrost/Reheat. When ready to use, thaw overnight in the refrigerator then reheat in the microwave, crockpot or stove according to aforementioned instructions.\nINSTRUCTIONS\nChop meat into bite size pieces. While meat is still on the cutting board, toss it with 1 teaspoon salt and \u00bd teaspoon pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add half of the beef to the very hot skillet and let cook undisturbed for approximately 2 minutes, or until nicely seared on one side, then continue to cook while stirring until beef is browned all over but not cooked through. Remove beef to 6-quart (or larger) slow cooker. Repeat with remaining beef.\nAdd all of the vegetables and garlic to the slow cooker and toss with the beef.\nAdd all the the Beef Gravy Broth ingredients to the now empty skillet (wipe out excess grease but leave brown bits). The flour will be lumpy at first but will dissolve as you cook and continue to whisk. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer until thickened to the consistency of gravy. Add to slow cooker and toss to combine. Add bay leaf. The Gravy will be very thick but will thin to the perfect consistency as moisture is released from the vegetables as they cook.\nCook on HIGH for 4-6 hours or on LOW for 8-10 hours or until vegetables and beef are very tender.

My husband came alive with joy after his first bites of this delicious stew! This after a work day and 2 hour commute He invited his golf buddies over this weekend to to share it with. I had recently sorted thru and tossed expired spices. Even without thyme, Dijon mustard or beef consomm\u00e9 or bay leaves- it was amazing! I used more unsalted beef broth a little extra regular soy sauce and preseasoned lightly with kosher salt and pepper before serving. I kept the red potatoes a bit larger so they wouldn\u2019t break down and cooked about 8?1/2 hours. Going to make an encore this week doubling the recipe. I may even cook an additional stew in Dutch oven to share with neighbors. I will be ordering your book as well! All the best to you!\n\nREPLY\n\nJEN\n\nWow Karen!

I made this recipe exactly as written along with the pumpkin honey cornbread muffins for my husband and 1 year old son over the weekend and it was a huge hit! My husband added some chili oil to give it more heat. Will be making it again. Thanks Monique!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2022-12-23 01:38:57WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 437349\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Lisa\n    [comment_author_email] => lisaepp@telus.net\n    [comment_author_url] => \n    [comment_author_IP] => 2001:569:7fc3:7000:2495:867f:8d95:ac3d\n    [comment_date] => 2022-12-22 19:38:57\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-12-23 01:38:57\n    [comment_content] => Please give me your recipe for pumpkin cornbread muffins\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/15.5 Safari/605.1.15\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 124755\n    [user_id] => 0\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [437640] => WP_Comment Object\n                (\n                    [comment_ID] => 437640\n                    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n                    [comment_author] => Monique\n                    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n                    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n                    [comment_author_IP] => 71.171.118.252\n                    [comment_date] => 2022-12-26 09:45:12\n                    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-12-26 15:45:12\n                    [comment_content] => Here you go!

After every bite, my 2 year old looked at his dad and said \u201cit\u2019s good, right?!\u201d That didn\u2019t get old \ud83d\ude42\nI made it according to the instructions, including the full 4 tablespoons of chili powder, which was perfect and not at all spicy. I have mckormicks dark chili powder.\nThe only change I made was adding sweet potato, which was great! I diced one big sweet potato (didn\u2019t bother peeling it) and added it in the beginning with the other veggies. I did not add any additional liquid or seasonings. It was perfect.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2025-01-06 21:13:58WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 526718\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 71.201.93.55\n    [comment_date] => 2025-01-06 15:13:58\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2025-01-06 21:13:58\n    [comment_content] => Amazing!

So you just used diced tomatoes and chicken broth instead of tomato sauce, correct? This has to lower the sugar quite a bit.\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nFareeha\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        November 17, 2015\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Oh wow, this is simply amazingly delicious..

You want to simmer your chili uncovered to allow it to simmer down a bit.  Mine came out perfect and was delicious.  I added 1/2 a finely diced seeded jalapeno w/ the veggies and accidentally drained one of the cans of tomatoes before realizing I wasn't supposed to, so I added a whole can of Rotel Hot tomatoes and it was delicious.

You want to simmer your chili uncovered to allow it to simmer down a bit.  Mine came out perfect and was delicious.

It\u2019s not easy to calculate this, it depends on what exact meat do you use, as Monique said. I calculated this recipe (with no topping) on our Recipe Analyzer and here are estimated values per serving (1/6 of recipe):\n326 kcal\nProtein: 29.14 g\nFat: 5.74 g\nCarbohydrates: 45.26 g\nTotal saturated: 1.006 g\nTotal trans: 0.014 g\nCholesterol: 43 mg\nI assumed ground turkey free fat. As you can see, this values are not exactly te the same as provided on this post, it depends what ingredients do you use.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2016-07-03 03:01:20WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 24129\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Robin\n    [comment_author_email] => robin@4dexecutivesearch.com\n    [comment_author_url] => \n    [comment_author_IP] => 172.250.60.78\n    [comment_date] => 2016-07-02 22:01:20\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2016-07-03 03:01:20\n    [comment_content] => Loved this recipe!!

I never did see who you were commenting to when scrolling through the MANY comments about this recipe, but thank you nonetheless.\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nCandace\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 17, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    LOVED IT AND SO DID MY HUSBAND!!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nBette\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 19, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    This is a good recipe for turkey chili. I changed few things as I always do. I used Rotel tomatoes with green chilis, low salt. I added a chopped seeded Jalepeno.  I used beef broth instead of chicken. Frozen corn.  I also added a cup.of black rice.\nJust a side note: It wax already a d3 Lucio us recipe.\nThanks\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nKristina\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 20, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    I made this tonight.

Chili. Is. AMAZING. I made it today since it\u2019s super cold in New England and I honestly just want to sit inside the pot of it and never get out. I HIGHLY recommend it.

I feel like I eat most anything, so I\u2019m feeling kind of weird that this felt so spicy to me. \ud83d\ude42 None of my kids could eat it so my husband and I are left with the huge batch. I\u2019m pretty sure cayenne pepper is spicier than chili powder, so I\u2019ll probably leave that out, and maybe take the chili powder down to 3 TBSP instead of 4. I also split the chili powder-half regular and half chipotle chili powder. I also made the pumpkin cornbread muffins and they helped soften the spice if I ate a bite of the muffin with a bite of the chili.\nThanks for the recipes! This was an easy meal to make, which is so helpful on busy days!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2016-01-23 05:08:14WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 20903\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => http://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 73.8.27.217\n    [comment_date] => 2016-01-22 23:08:14\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2016-01-23 05:08:14\n    [comment_content] => So strange!

I use red chili powder from the Indian grocery stores.  I think even 1, maybe 2 would be the right amount, and at least a good start, and then people can adjust as they see fit.

If you read most American \"chili powder\" labels, they often include other ingredients. The one in my cabinet says: chili pepper, salt, cumin, oregano, garlic. The ingredient label on the package from the Indian store says: chili pepper.\n                                    [comment_karma] => 0\n                                    [comment_approved] => 1\n                                    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 6.0.1; SM-T550 Build/MMB29M) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.91 Safari/537.36\n                                    [comment_type] => comment\n                                    [comment_parent] => 23376\n                                    [user_id] => 0\n                                    [children:protected] => Array\n                                        (\n                                        )\n\n                                    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n                                    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n                                        (\n                                            [0] => post_author\n                                            [1] => post_date\n                                            [2] => post_date_gmt\n                                            [3] => post_content\n                                            [4] => post_title\n                                            [5] => post_excerpt\n                                            [6] => post_status\n                                            [7] => comment_status\n                                            [8] => ping_status\n                                            [9] => post_name\n                                            [10] => to_ping\n                                            [11] => pinged\n                                            [12] => post_modified\n                                            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n                                            [14] => post_content_filtered\n                                            [15] => post_parent\n                                            [16] => guid\n                                            [17] => menu_order\n                                            [18] => post_type\n                                            [19] => post_mime_type\n                                            [20] => comment_count\n                                        )\n\n                                )\n\n                            [187212] => WP_Comment Object\n                                (\n                                    [comment_ID] => 187212\n                                    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n                                    [comment_author] => Becca\n                                    [comment_author_email] => xrx0becca0xrx@aim.com\n                                    [comment_author_url] => \n                                    [comment_author_IP] => 70.89.206.225\n                                    [comment_date] => 2018-06-25 12:18:08\n                                    [comment_date_gmt] => 2018-06-25 17:18:08\n                                    [comment_content] => I had the same experience. I usually enjoy spicy food but with this I couldn't even finish a serving without it hurting my whole mouth.  I'm not using spices from an Indian grocery store, but I agree 4 TBS was way too much. Since the spice was so mild in the original recipe, it should be adjusted that way. If anything the recipe should say 2 TBS and then people can add more to taste. \n\nOh well, thanks for the recipe, but considering changing the actual recipe instead of leaving a paragraph at the bottom saying your using a less spicy chili powder,its easy to overlook and not an easy fix once you add too much.\n                                    [comment_karma] => 0\n                                    [comment_approved] => 1\n                                    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.87 Safari/537.36\n                                    [comment_type] => comment\n                                    [comment_parent] => 23376\n                                    [user_id] => 0\n                                    [children:protected] => Array\n                                        (\n                                        )\n\n                                    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n                                    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n                                        (\n                                            [0] => post_author\n                                            [1] => post_date\n                                            [2] => post_date_gmt\n                                            [3] => post_content\n                                            [4] => post_title\n                                            [5] => post_excerpt\n                                            [6] => post_status\n                                            [7] => comment_status\n                                            [8] => ping_status\n                                            [9] => post_name\n                                            [10] => to_ping\n                                            [11] => pinged\n                                            [12] => post_modified\n                                            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n                                            [14] => post_content_filtered\n                                            [15] => post_parent\n                                            [16] => guid\n                                            [17] => menu_order\n                                            [18] => post_type\n                                            [19] => post_mime_type\n                                            [20] => comment_count\n                                        )\n\n                                )\n\n                        )\n\n                    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n                    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n                        (\n                            [0] => post_author\n                            [1] => post_date\n                            [2] => post_date_gmt\n                            [3] => post_content\n                            [4] => post_title\n                            [5] => post_excerpt\n                            [6] => post_status\n                            [7] => comment_status\n                            [8] => ping_status\n                            [9] => post_name\n                            [10] => to_ping\n                            [11] => pinged\n                            [12] => post_modified\n                            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n                            [14] => post_content_filtered\n                            [15] => post_parent\n                            [16] => guid\n                            [17] => menu_order\n                            [18] => post_type\n                            [19] => post_mime_type\n                            [20] => comment_count\n                        )\n\n                )\n\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Monique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 22, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    So strange! Can I ask what kind of chili powder you use? I use McCormick and mine is perfect and definitely not too spicy to eat (I\u2019ve made this recipe about 10x now!).\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2016-05-23 01:27:09WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 23376\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Tazin\n    [comment_author_email] => tazin_yunis@yahoo.com\n    [comment_author_url] => \n    [comment_author_IP] => 69.235.192.126\n    [comment_date] => 2016-05-22 20:27:09\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2016-05-23 01:27:09\n    [comment_content] => The same thing happened to me and I only used 3 Tablespoons of Red Chili instead of  4 TBS and it was way too much.  I use red chili powder from the Indian grocery stores.  I think even 1, maybe 2 would be the right amount, and at least a good start, and then people can adjust as they see fit.

If anything the recipe should say 2 TBS and then people can add more to taste. \n\nOh well, thanks for the recipe, but considering changing the actual recipe instead of leaving a paragraph at the bottom saying your using a less spicy chili powder,its easy to overlook and not an easy fix once you add too much.\n                    [comment_karma] => 0\n                    [comment_approved] => 1\n                    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.87 Safari/537.36\n                    [comment_type] => comment\n                    [comment_parent] => 23376\n                    [user_id] => 0\n                    [children:protected] => Array\n                        (\n                        )\n\n                    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n                    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n                        (\n                            [0] => post_author\n                            [1] => post_date\n                            [2] => post_date_gmt\n                            [3] => post_content\n                            [4] => post_title\n                            [5] => post_excerpt\n                            [6] => post_status\n                            [7] => comment_status\n                            [8] => ping_status\n                            [9] => post_name\n                            [10] => to_ping\n                            [11] => pinged\n                            [12] => post_modified\n                            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n                            [14] => post_content_filtered\n                            [15] => post_parent\n                            [16] => guid\n                            [17] => menu_order\n                            [18] => post_type\n                            [19] => post_mime_type\n                            [20] => comment_count\n                        )\n\n                )\n\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Tazin\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        May 22, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    The same thing happened to me and I only used 3 Tablespoons of Red Chili instead of  4 TBS and it was way too much.

I didn\u2019t have oregano so I used Italian seasoning and also used crushed red pepper instead of cayenne. I will definitely be making this again \u2014 beats the previous recipe I used to use with packets of taco and ranch seasoning!!!

Only changes I made were minor. I put in about 5 cloves of minced garlic and used two different brands of beans. One from Goya had some kind of red sauce I couldnt get off but it tasted great! I also added a few tablespoons of brown sugar at the end to kill the heat for my wife. She NEVER eats chili. As I write this she is on her 4th bowl!

Made a few tweaks to adjust to I ingredients I had on hand.\n2 1/2 T chili powder in lieu of 4T\n1T Trader Joes 21 Seasoning Salute\n(Was out of Oregano so used this as a substitute and since it also has cumin in it I only used 1 t of actual cumin)\nChicken broth\u2026only used 1 cup in lieu of 1 1/4 cup\nDiced Tomatoes\u2013used 1-15oz can in lieu of what recipe calls for.\nSubstituted one can of pinto beans for 2nd can kidney beans\nOrange & yellow peppers rather than red\nTurned out fabulous. I think I added a tad extra sea salt and some extra cayenne pepper but it really wasn\u2019t overly spicy. Thanks for the great recipe!\nGoing to have to try out the suggestion to use Garbanzo beans, cinnamon and nutmeg\u2026\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nOlivia\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        February 2, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    This turned out awesome.

I cooked it in the crockpot, but first did all of step 1 as listed above. I then added the cooked and seasoned meat, onion, and pepper, to the crockpot wit all the other ingredients. Cooked on low for 7 hours and then took off the top and simmered for an hour to thicken it. Also added a splash of balsamic vinegar.

I came across your recipe a few days ago and made it tonight and we absolutely loved it!!  This is the first chili recipe that I will want to make over and over again.  I am not huge kidney bean fan so I only used one can and found it was the perfect amount for us.  I was so hungry and anxious to eat that I even forgot to use the toppings!!  Good thing we are a two person household and will have left overs for a few days.  Thanks for sharing!  I look forward to cooking more of your recipes.\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nmummybites\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        March 30, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Thanks for the inspiration!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nkim\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        April 3, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    What an Awesome Chili !!!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nNicole\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        April 3, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    I\u2019m a little late to the game, but I\u2019m making your chili this afternoon.

I tried it for lunch and it was so good. I\u2019m not a hot chili person but I like spices in my food.  I thought it was just perfect. I just stored it away and a tiny bit and tastes the spices. Although I didn\u2019t have cayenne pepper I put black pepper lol \nI will be making it again. Directions were on point and honestly I don\u2019t like the crock pot  I put it in for the 45 minutes. Ok enough said \nThanks\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nAndrew\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        April 11, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    I have just made this Chilli and feel very annoyed.  I chose this recipe because of the 5 star rating.  I fell sure the recipe has a mistake.  4 tablespoons of chilli powder is ridiculous.  Just had to throw it all in the bin. Waste of money and my time.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2016-11-23 01:16:47WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 27998\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Kylie\n    [comment_author_email] => Kyscott08@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => \n    [comment_author_IP] => 98.181.10.245\n    [comment_date] => 2016-11-22 19:16:47\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2016-11-23 01:16:47\n    [comment_content] => You threw it out because it had 4 tbsp of chili powder?

I am making this chili for dinner tonight for the second time in a weeks (WAY TOO DELICIOUS NOT TO MAKE IT AGAIN!) However, I am doubling the recipe since I am cooking for my in laws tonight. Do you recommend doubling all the ingredients? I read your recommendation on the chicken broth and already measured only 2 cups.

Recommend those that are sensitive to heat to try this technique. Thanks for the Recipe.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2016-06-15 00:51:53WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 23898\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Lisa\n    [comment_author_email] => lisamschinella@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => \n    [comment_author_IP] => 76.88.92.64\n    [comment_date] => 2016-06-14 19:51:53\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2016-06-15 00:51:53\n    [comment_content] => also, i used ground pork and tasted the same as ground turkey\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/601.6.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/9.1.1 Safari/537.86.6\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 23897\n    [user_id] => 0\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Lisa\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        June 14, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    also, i used ground pork and tasted the same as ground turkey\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nLisa\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        June 14, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    also, i used ground pork and tasted the same as ground turkey\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nElisabeth Bandy\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        June 30, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    I made this chili tonight and it was fabulous!  I have to admit I tweaked it a little.  I did half ground sausage and half turkey because I needed wanted to give it a little kick with the meat (yeah\u2026it is a little fattier) and my sob curls up his lips when turkey is mentioned. The chili powder was half regular chili powder and half Hot Mexican chili powder.  Gives it a nice spiciness.  Great recipe!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMelissa\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        July 12, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    I just made this for maybe the third time since I found the recipe on Pinterest. It really is the best chili. I think it\u2019s the chicken broth that kicks it up a notch. It\u2019s so much more flavorful than chili I usually make. Love it!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nJonathan\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        July 12, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    I made this chilli once before and loved it and I tried again tonight, and while it tastes yummy, the broth is very liquid. I made it in the same way but all I can think of that was different is the first time I took it over to a friend\u2019s house after making it and reheated it there. Should I let this cool and see if it thickens after that? Or is there something else I should do to thicken it now?

I also doubled the tomatoes and seasons and added another pound of meat. Excellent! Thanks for sharing!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nAna\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        September 7, 2016\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Great chili recipe!

It\u2019s fantastic!! Topped it with a 1/4 avocado, dollop of plain Greek yogurt, and a liiittttle bit of sharp cheddar.

Made it for the first time last week. We\u2019re huge spicy food fans but I dislike bell peppers, so I just subbed the bell pepper for 4 seeded jalape\u00f1os. Oh and I used some grilled corn I had in the freezer instead of the canned corn, and it still turned out delicious.

Browned the garlic and onions on the stove stop first with olive oil. Put in the turkey, browned that. Threw in the crock, with the tomatoes, corn and beans. (I hate beans so I did one can!)  my local store had no red peppers anywhere so that\u2019s the only thing I left out. Measured spices & everything else to the T and this came out SO DELICIOUS. I also wanna add I like soupy chili so I did keep the original recipe for the chicken broth.( I noticed your side note just before commenting lol so it\u2019s ok that I kept your recipe exact aside from the beans & red bell) My mom does \u201cbox flavor\u201d for chili and she would just die over this.

I also substituted garbanzo beans for the corn and used a heaping teaspoon of Emeril\u2019s southwest seasoning mix. I drained the liquid after I saut\u00e9ed the vegetables and turkey.

I tried to swing it my way, saying that red kidney beans are a \u201cmeatier bean\u201d and that he would be ok. He said ok. Smelled amazing! We did it in the crockpot and couldn\u2019t wait the 3hrs, so we added some flour to thicken it and served it up. Decided to use tortilla chips to dip, and I put sour cream/cheese/avocado on mine. Heaven!! We both LOVED it!! The chips added extra salt so we didnt need more than the 1/4tsp the recipe called for. We are only sad that 1 serving was so little haha. We may cheat a little and have extra.

I love that it is easy to put in the crockpot too. I\u2019m always looking for food that is on the healthier side and with all the veggies and turkey instead of red meat, this one is definitely a win.\nThanks for making healthy so easy,\nKatie\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2017-11-12 17:37:23WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 151818\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Megan\n    [comment_author_email] => Mefleming@mac.com\n    [comment_author_url] => \n    [comment_author_IP] => 107.77.224.69\n    [comment_date] => 2017-11-12 11:37:23\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2017-11-12 17:37:23\n    [comment_content] => When you put in the crock pot do you use 1 1/4 cup of chicken broth still ?

I made it last night and my husband & I both loved it. I used 1 can of red kidney beans and 1 can of black beans just to mix things up a little. I think chickpeas would also be delicious in it, and I might try adding a green pepper as well. I also added a little extra chicken broth (probably 2 cups total) because it didn\u2019t seem like there would be quite enough liquid to simmer for 1/2 hour; and I used 1/2 tsp cayenne instead of 1/4 which was the perfect amount of spicy for us. So happy I get to bring this for lunch today!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nAndrea Nicole\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 6, 2017\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nThis is the BEST turkey chili recipe ever!

I didn\u2019t realize it called for 2 cans of kidney beans, so I threw in a can of black beans. I added a little extra chili powder and a jalape\u00f1o, because my boyfriend and I are spicy food junkies. It\u2019s national bean day, so I thought this would be a perfect way to celebrate. Haha\nIt\u2019s AMAZING. I never leave comments, but this totaaaaallly deserved one. Love love love love it.

I wish I didn\u2019t leave out the extra chili powder! I added jalapenos to my serving, as well as some plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I wouldn\u2019t use a crock pot, only because this took me about an hour to make from start to finish. I\u2019ll definitely be taking a look at more AK\u2019s recipes!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nBarbara\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 13, 2017\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nWe love the recipe just as is but my daughter makes a vat of it and adds white, red and black beans in it for color.  McCormicks apple dry rub is a nice touch also\u2026.adds a little smoke flavor.

I use a whole bag of chopped broccoli instead of corn.  I used 6oz tomato paste + 22oz water instead of canned tomatoes. Sometimes I add a cup of cooked quinoa for a thicker chili.  I have made this at least 6Xs and I take it to work for my lunch.  It\u2019s such a great recipe and so easy to make.\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nLinda\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 15, 2017\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    This is my first time EVER substituting beef with turkey.

I cooked the chili Saturday night in a saut\u00e9 pan, uncovered, which made it nice and thick. After reading the reviews, I used 3 tbsp. of chili powder instead of 4. It wasn\u2019t spicy enough for me, but I put out sliced jalape\u00f1os with the other toppings. On Sunday I reheated it in a crock pot.The women were happy it was made with ground \u2018turkey\u2019 instead of beef.\nLeftovers were great for tacos!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nrebekah\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        February 1, 2017\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    love love love this recipe!!!!

I am going to make this in the crockpot but I have a question regarding your notes- it says to reduce the chicken broth from 1 1/4 cups to 1/2 cup but in a comment by a user you advised to use 1 cup of chicken broth (she was doubling is it was then 2 cups).  Can you confirm for me please?  This sounds sooo good and health btw and I am looking forward to making this on Saturday \ud83d\ude42\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2017-03-09 23:15:05WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 74248\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => http://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 216.80.110.47\n    [comment_date] => 2017-03-09 17:15:05\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2017-03-09 23:15:05\n    [comment_content] => Stick with 1/2 cup if you are not doubling the recipe and want a thick chili. :)\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh;

Didn\u2019t have any of the traditional toppings, but added a small amount of French\u2019s Fried Onions before eating (the kind from green bean casseroles!) and yum yum\u2026\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nJared\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        April 1, 2017\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    THis has become my go to chili recipe.

Definitely doing this instead of my usual beef mince chilli.\nOnly used a half teaspoon of chilli powder as I\u2019m in the UK and our chilli powder is very different to US stuff.  Before I knew that I almost killed my husband with a 2 tbsp recipe \u2013 4 would definitely finish him off! (I now have a cunning plan should I ever need his life insurance money\u2026) \ud83d\ude09\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nApril\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        May 9, 2017\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    This IS the best chili ever!!! I have made this a few times now and we LOVE it!! We use Mc Cormicks \u201cMexican\u201d spicy chili and it\u2019s PERFECT!  Every time I make this everyone loves it! I love that it\u2019s lean turkey lots of veggies and protein, so as long as I go easy on the cheesy/sour cream topping haha it\u2019s pretty healthy and filling!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nGarima\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        June 29, 2017\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Just to try something different, do you think we can substitute the kidney beans with garbanzo beans?

I used a basic bottled chili \u2018powder\u2019 as opposed to the stuff that is in those little packets like McCormick\u2019s Mild chili \u2018packet.\u2019 Mine ended up soupy, and required a little bit of corn starch to thicken. The packets have wheat flour in them, and actual chili powder does not so I believe this is where my mistake was made.\nHope this helps someone!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nChris\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        September 17, 2017\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    This is a fantastic recipe! I\u2019m a meat eater but always looking for different ideas and I actually prefer this recipe over my usual beef/pork recipe! I like to cook my chilis a bit longer\u2026 really get those flavors together so I had to add an extra cup of broth. It was not soupy at all. Even after the first 45 min. I used 2.5 tbsp of regular chili powder. It was perfect, I can\u2019t wait to make this again. Everyone loved it.

I was nervous but it came out delicious.\nI added butternut squash, mushrooms and some kale just because we had it at home and it goes great.\nUsed 5 table spoons of chili powder and it has the perfect little kick to it. any more would have been too much\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2017-09-19 21:47:09WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 145418\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => http://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2017-09-19 16:47:09\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2017-09-19 21:47:09\n    [comment_content] => Amazing!

I didn\u2019t have pepper so I added some mushrooms I had on hand and it worked out well. I felt the 4 tbsp of chili powder sounded a bit much so I added 1 tbsp instead and it was the perfect amount of heat for us.

Buuuuut, if I wanted to make this without Chicken broth would there be a huge difference? Or should I just use it anyways? I was also going to use 3lbs of ground turkey and only double the rest of the ingredients but I wanted to know first if that would be too much meat compared to everything else? If it is I\u2019ll just triple the recipe. I plan on making this tomorrow night. (We have a family of four and they are big eaters, plus we freeze leftovers).

I\u2019m always looking for healthy alternatives and this was super easy, along with filling my home with AMAZING aromas.. I will definitely share this recipe and add it to my book. It was a little spicy, but I LOVE spice so I even added an entire jalape\u00f1o on mine, but didn\u2019t for my boyfriend, who also loved it! Thank you so much!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2018-01-25 22:30:49WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 159958\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => http://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.121.62\n    [comment_date] => 2018-01-25 16:30:49\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2018-01-25 22:30:49\n    [comment_content] => I'm so happy to hear this!

Made it tonight for dinner \ud83d\ude0b It was a last minute idea so I had to substitute the kidney beans with chickpeas (used 1 can) and I didn\u2019t have chicken broth but it still came out amazing! In place of the chicken broth I used water and just upped the spices. I added frozen peaches and cream corn and saut\u00e9ed celery with the onion and red peppers. I topped it with Cheddar cheese, avocado, a little cream cheese (didn\u2019t have sour cream) and cilantro. My husband loves it too!

Even my husband approved who typically only like steak, burgers and pizza.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2018-02-06 22:17:28WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 163209\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => http://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2018-02-06 16:17:28\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2018-02-06 22:17:28\n    [comment_content] => Amazing!

I made a double batch of this recipe as written but threw in a few extra veggies that I had on hand (carrots, celery, zucchini\u2014the last added just before simmering) + dried chipotles, red chilis, and fresh jalape\u00f1o.  For me it had a nice flavour and was not overly spicy.  I grew up in Minn. but lived for a few years in Texas which may have slightly dulled my sensitivity to pepper!  Thanks for a great recipe\u2014I am now a follower!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2018-05-03 18:00:28WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 180483\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => http://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 173.20.36.135\n    [comment_date] => 2018-05-03 13:00:28\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2018-05-03 18:00:28\n    [comment_content] => Everyone's heat sensitivities are so different!

I first came across this recipie about 3 years ago. I fell completely in love with it as I was trying to create a healthier eating lifestyle. We always enjoyed red meats a little too much so I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. I can\u2019t even tell the difference. My picky father refuses to eat turkey and he didn\u2019t even know that\u2019s what I fed him. So with that being said I make this chili often and I triple the batch. We either share it with parents or I just freeze some for a different day and we eat the rest throughout the week. I also have a habit of having all the ingredients including the broth and canned goods on hand so if the mood strikes me I just throw it all together and don\u2019t even have to do any shopping for it. I think that means I really like it. Now that we are getting back on track once again with healthier eating, I will definitely check out your other recipes.

Very tasty and just enough spice! I did reduce the amount of chili powder because we love Cholula in our chili but we didn\u2019t need it. I cooked a chicken breast in the bouillon water first then cut it up into the onion and peppers. I also would use diced tomatoes next time as it did seem a bit more tomato-y with the crushed. Very good though and will be making this again!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2018-10-31 22:12:27WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 198288\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => http://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.123.212\n    [comment_date] => 2018-10-31 17:12:27\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2018-10-31 22:12:27\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

I live in England and can\u2019t get American chili powder here. I didn\u2019t realize that chili powder was a blend of spices until I nearly made smoke coming out of my ears making chili with the UK version of chili powder. I make my own blend from a Genius Kitchen recipe but reduce the cayenne a fair bit for the kids.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2018-11-19 22:55:21WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 200588\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => http://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 50.193.124.138\n    [comment_date] => 2018-11-19 16:55:21\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2018-11-19 22:55:21\n    [comment_content] => Chili powder can definitely vary, but thankfully it's easy to cut back on in here.

Thank-you, Monique for sharing it! I\u2019ve been sitting here though trying to figure out what\u2019s what. I thought it tasty a bit too salty, but now I\u2019m wondering if what I tasted was not salt at all but maybe one of the spices. I\u2019d like to figure that out so I can adjust next time. I am the only one in my house who eats chili so I have two big containers for lunches for the entire week. Also wondering if I could freeze one or if it won\u2019t be the same when thawed and reheated. This will be my go to recipe from now on!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2018-12-31 20:26:44WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 207114\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => http://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2018-12-31 14:26:44\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2018-12-31 20:26:44\n    [comment_content] => So glad you loved this one, Barbara!

Think I\u2019ll add more turkey the next time to make it a little more meaty \ud83d\ude42\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2019-01-16 03:40:23WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 209891\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => http://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2019-01-15 21:40:23\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2019-01-16 03:40:23\n    [comment_content] => Perfect for game day!

I have made it numerous times and passed it out to family and friends and they can\u2019t get enough of it. I tweak the recipe a little and do one can of kidney beans and one can of black beans . Tonight I\u2019m gonna do it with shredded chicken instead of ground d turkey breast. I have never commented on someone\u2019s recipe bc I guess I don\u2019t make the effort but had to give you a shout and let you know how popular this has been in my home. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2019-01-30 15:58:33WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 211256\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => http://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2019-01-30 09:58:33\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2019-01-30 15:58:33\n    [comment_content] => Thanks so much for your comment, Megan!

Already shared the recipe with a lot of my friends and they\u2019re all excited to try it!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\njordan\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        February 1, 2019\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nI am making this recipe for the second time.

It was absolutely delicious! I usually use ground beef, however, this chili is so flavourful I don\u2019t even notice the difference. The best part is that one generous serving is one smart point on the Weight Watchers program.\nI\u2019ll be sure to follow more of your recipes. Thanks!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2019-02-12 17:42:18WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 212039\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => http://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2019-02-12 11:42:18\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2019-02-12 17:42:18\n    [comment_content] => Hi Shelley!

The only problem was it seemed a little dry so I added extra chicken broth which helped. The next day the leftovers were extremely dry. I don\u2019t know why. Might have to add even more chicken broth next time, but I don\u2019t want to be like a soup.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2019-03-27 15:41:51WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 214150\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => http://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.121.62\n    [comment_date] => 2019-03-27 10:41:51\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2019-03-27 15:41:51\n    [comment_content] => Interesting -- perhaps you simmered it on too high of heat.

Change the actual recipe to tell people that you used mild chilli instead because it\u2019s not a given. This recipe is inedible with that amount of spice\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2019-06-14 23:23:55WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 223874\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => http://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2019-06-14 18:23:55\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2019-06-14 23:23:55\n    [comment_content] => I used a generic chili powder and have tried several versions without issue.

For most of my adult life I have tried to find a good recipe that gives me that same satisfaction. I am making this recipe today in the crockpot and my house smells amazing! I snuck a little bit too just to see and it tastes as good as it smells! Although it is not anything like my moms this will definitely go into the recipe book to do again! It\u2019s delicious!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2019-10-14 21:01:28WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 230048\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 66.248.200.20\n    [comment_date] => 2019-10-14 16:01:28\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2019-10-14 21:01:28\n    [comment_content] => I'm so happy you found this recipe!

I only use 2TBS of chili powder and 1 can of beans (my kids aren\u2019t bean fans). I make a double batch when we have company, it\u2019s easy to heat up and very filling. Everyone always asks for the recipe. I\u2019ve also frozen it and it defrosts great.

It is easy to make and the thickness comes out perfectly. The flavor is also amazing with just the right amount of spice. It has also been really easy to tweek this recipe when I needed to. I have made it vegetarian in the past by substituting the ground turkey with an extra can (or two) of beans and I have also tried a version with cut up carrots, and celery which worked out great.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2019-10-24 15:47:11WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 230639\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 66.248.200.20\n    [comment_date] => 2019-10-24 10:47:11\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2019-10-24 15:47:11\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

Highly recommend \ud83d\ude42\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2019-10-29 00:06:16WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 230827\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 66.248.200.20\n    [comment_date] => 2019-10-28 19:06:16\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2019-10-29 00:06:16\n    [comment_content] => So happy to hear that! To thicken it up make sure you use crushed tomatoes and do not cover the pot at all, as this will create condensation.

I made it sans corn as a preference and added some chipotle powder to give it a little heat. I also used some garlic salt in place of regular salt to kick up the garlic flavor a tad more. Mine only took about 20 minutes of simmering for the ingredients to come together. I served this with some steamed broccoli and crackers. I can\u2019t wait to eat it again for lunch tomorrow!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2019-10-30 21:10:24WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 230965\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 66.248.200.20\n    [comment_date] => 2019-10-30 16:10:24\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2019-10-30 21:10:24\n    [comment_content] => Amazing!

I made it earlier today for my son & I. It was the perfect dish for a cold, rainy wintry night and it achieved the coveted \u201cmake it again\u201d rating. That, I will do.\nNote: Another user mentioned that 4 TBSP chili powder might be a bit on the high side so I only used 3 TBSP (Great Value brand) and the spiciness was just right.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2019-11-13 15:40:34WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 231840\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 66.248.200.20\n    [comment_date] => 2019-11-13 09:40:34\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2019-11-13 15:40:34\n    [comment_content] => Perfect for a cold night!

I make it often when it gets cold out. I sometimes swap the ground turkey for ground tofu crumbles, and that is also wonderful. My recent discovery is that the absolute BEST topping for this chili is homemade pickled jalape\u00f1os! It takes like 10 minutes while the chili is cooking, you just bring vinegar, water, salt, garlic, and a little bit of sugar to a boil and then just toss in some sliced jalape\u00f1os and let them soak it up! They are transformative on this dish, a perfect burst of a sweet and spicy kick!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2019-11-25 21:11:55WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 232608\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 66.248.200.20\n    [comment_date] => 2019-11-25 15:11:55\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2019-11-25 21:11:55\n    [comment_content] => YUM pickled jalape\u00f1os sounds amazing on this.

I noticed two things in the nutrition count and would like to know how I can reduce the carb count? Also, I see that there is no sodium count, which is extremely important if you are following a healthier lifestyle as we all know what sodium does to us!!!!!! Can you say BLOATED fast enough. Your recipe looks delicious and can\u2019t wait for you input so that I can try.\nHappy Thanksgiving to you!\nPaula\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2019-12-03 18:45:26WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 233050\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 66.248.200.20\n    [comment_date] => 2019-12-03 12:45:26\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2019-12-03 18:45:26\n    [comment_content] => Hi Paula!

As easy as chopping it all up and throwing it in a big pot and you have a delicious meal with plenty for leftovers!! So tasty and filling we both loved it!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2019-12-03 23:41:59WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 233065\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 66.248.200.20\n    [comment_date] => 2019-12-03 17:41:59\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2019-12-03 23:41:59\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

I think the feedback you received about the heat was perhaps due to the 1/4 t. of cayenne and not the amount of chili powder?  I added a hearty pinch of cayenne and felt it was enough.  I actually ran out of chili powder and only had enough for 3 T. but it was plenty and my family really enjoyed your recipe!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2019-12-03 23:39:40WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 233062\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 66.248.200.20\n    [comment_date] => 2019-12-03 17:39:40\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2019-12-03 23:39:40\n    [comment_content] => Glad you enjoyed!

I do change a bit the spices. I put one teaspoon of chili flakes instead of the chilli powder and don\u2019t put cayenne pepper just a bit of normal black pepper. I add just one teaspoon of cumin and the suggested oregano amount.

The flavors and seasonings were perfect. The recipe is easy to make and the cooking was completed within 60 minutes. The only modifications I made was I added a green bell pepper, 1/2 lb extra of ground dark meat chicken, and substituted beef broth for the chicken broth.  I served it up with homemade corn bread; the dinner was delicious!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2019-12-09 21:14:35WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 233429\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 66.248.200.20\n    [comment_date] => 2019-12-09 15:14:35\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2019-12-09 21:14:35\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

I found your recipe a couple years ago and make this several times a month. It gets packed in my 9 year old\u2019s thermos to take to school for lunch. My husband and I add Mezzetta jalape\u00f1os for some extra spice. It is so delicious and light and a meal we constantly look forward to eating.

I made a few changes to make it a more traditional chili.  I used 93% lean ground turkey. From experience the 99% just doesn\u2019t have enough flavor. I used slightly more onions as I like them in chili. Green pepper instead of red \u2013 what I had on hand. I used only 1 cup chicken broth but also added 12 oz beer as I always add beer to chili. Lastly I deleted the corn \u2013 while I love corn it\u2019s not traditional in chili and I prefer it as a side. That\u2019s all and it turned out great. I feel this recipe would easily accommodate any minor changes you may wish to make. I did not find it overly spicy at all \u2013 just enough.

I used a little less chili powder the second time around because it was a bit too spicy but I did add a tad bit of unsweetened coconut milk to bring it down. I know it sounds odd but you can\u2019t even taste it! I also added a little bit more chicken broth and it came out perfect!!

Topped it with some cheese and a side of the honey pumpkin cornbread muffins and a great meal was had. I made a batch for my friend\u2019s post baby meal train and she and her husband loved it. I made another batch for my own meal prep for the week and froze some of the leftovers which reheated well.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-02-20 23:12:15WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 238619\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-02-20 17:12:15\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-02-20 23:12:15\n    [comment_content] => Love that!

It\u2019s a great base to use up veggies that need eating \u2013 added half an eggplant (no one else was gonna eat it), zucchini and carrots, also some sriracha sauce. The spice mixture is perfect. Also the stores are out of canned tomatoes so i used 3 cups diced fresh tomatoes and 2 cups broth instead, and found the consistency was perfect. (what a time when fresh veggies are more readily available??)\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-03-20 14:12:20WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 240795\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-03-20 09:12:20\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-03-20 14:12:20\n    [comment_content] => Absolutely!

And we didn\u2019t use the oil, instead using Pam cooking spray to minimize the fat content. Award winning chili with flavor so amazing nobody would know it\u2019s ground turkey.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-03-31 15:45:23WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 242112\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-03-31 10:45:23\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-03-31 15:45:23\n    [comment_content] => Amazing!

I never post reviews but this one deserves recognition. My family loved this chili. I have picky eaters as well. Stop searching for the perfect recipe, you just found it. I followed the recommendation of other reviews and did not use all the chili powder. I cut back about one tablespoon or so. (I doubled the recipe) Enjoy!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-03-31 15:36:20WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 242082\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-03-31 10:36:20\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-03-31 15:36:20\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

Toppings such as cheese, avocado,  sour cream and corn chips make it also colourful and fun. It is one of the few recipes BOTH of my girls like. And that is not an easy feat: one is a carnavour and the other is leaning towards vegetarian. I also love the fact that it can be cooked in big batches and frozen for later. Still yummy. By the way, lean beef works just as well.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-03-31 15:31:35WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 242067\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-03-31 10:31:35\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-03-31 15:31:35\n    [comment_content] => Amazing!

I did add more garlic than specified. I also did not use any chicken broth as there was enough liquid in the diced tomatoes to make it soupy. I did not have to add any more liquid. I use McCormick chili powder so I used the whole 4 tablespoons. Not too spicy, just right.  I also added a can of black beans instead of corn. It came out fantastic. I will make this again soon.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-04-06 20:46:23WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 242756\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-04-06 15:46:23\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-04-06 20:46:23\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

I ate raw red kidney beans which are apparently poisonous. After spending a large amount of time in the bathroom, i called poison control and found out it was the red kidney beans that poisoned me. The recipe definitely didnt say to cook the beans separately or soak them or any of the things you are supposed to do to them. And im paying the price\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-04-09 16:40:24WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 243268\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-04-09 11:40:24\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-04-09 16:40:24\n    [comment_content] => Hi Matt!

My  husband , myself and three kids all agreed that this was better tasting than any beef chili i have made.  Super delicious, perfect seasonings.  Not too spicy.  I doubled  everything in the recipe but.. kept the beans to two cans,  corn to one can  and adjusted to  6 tablespoons of chili powder .  AWESOME!!

I was looking for ground turkey recipes and curious to try this especially because it claimed to be the best. Well it delivered! I doubled everything because I wanted leftovers but otherwise followed the recipe.

In other words, it\u2019s still white. I didn\u2019t want to add too much powder since I didn\u2019t want to risk going too strong with the flavor. It still has a chili smell, though, thanks to the beans\u2026.is the broth supposed to disappear before serving? Or do we serve it as a soup?\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-05-06 22:51:19WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 248195\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-05-06 17:51:19\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-05-06 22:51:19\n    [comment_content] => I'm not sure what went wrong here, but if you followed the recipe as written it will look like the photos and video in the post \ud83d\ude42 I'm not sure what you mean by 'white' unless you didn't use tomatoes\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/81.0.4044.129 Safari/537.36\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 247413\n    [user_id] => 1\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Monique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        May 6, 2020\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    I\u2019m not sure what went wrong here, but if you followed the recipe as written it will look like the photos and video in the post \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u2018white\u2019 unless you didn\u2019t use tomatoes\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMonique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        May 6, 2020\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    I\u2019m not sure what went wrong here, but if you followed the recipe as written it will look like the photos and video in the post \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u2018white\u2019 unless you didn\u2019t use tomatoes\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMia\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        May 5, 2020\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nThis recipe was so good!

I\u2019ve made it a few times and it is delish, however I add some cocoa powder and just a pinch of sugar (mom\u2019s secret ingredients). But BE SURE check the salt content of your chili powder and canned goods! I\u2019ve made this recipe a few times and it turned out great. But I made it tonight and it was EXTREMELY salty even though I added minimal salt and used low sodium broth. I\u2019m guessing it was the canned tomatoes I used (check for no salt added) or the chili powder (there is salt in chili powder and I used a new brand). Fixed it by adding a pinch more sugar, stirring in some sour cream, and adding a whole raw peeled potato while it simmered and reheated (I made ahead). Also served over pasta with cheese and more sour cream to curb the salt.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-06-02 15:00:46WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 252047\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-06-02 10:00:46\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-06-02 15:00:46\n    [comment_content] => Love that idea with the cocoa powder!

Easy to follow and tastes delicious, I\u2019ve made this recipe twice (both times I halved the recipe). Once with ground turkey and the other with ground pork \u2013 both turned out great! I also accidentally bought creamed corn instead of whole kernels but it was still delicious. The chili is very MILD, which I enjoy, but you\u2019ll have to add more heat if you want it more spicy!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nLinda Admiraal\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        June 18, 2020\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    The turkey chili was outstanding, delicious and everyone loves it over a nd over!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-06-18 21:32:15WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 253841\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-06-18 16:32:15\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-06-18 21:32:15\n    [comment_content] => So happy to hear that!\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.97 Safari/537.36\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 253824\n    [user_id] => 1\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Monique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        June 18, 2020\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    So happy to hear that!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMonique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        June 18, 2020\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    So happy to hear that!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nLisa\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        June 26, 2020\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nThis recipe lives up to its title!  Most turkey chili has a bland taste due to the nature of turkey being a bland meat\u2026but the spices in this recipe were PERFECT.  I also used McCormick chili powder, so it was not too spicy.  The flavor was absolutely delicious!  Highly recommend this recipe.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-06-30 02:04:21WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 255079\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-06-29 21:04:21\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-06-30 02:04:21\n    [comment_content] => Agreed!

I didn\u2019t change a thing (but I do use 99% fat free turkey) and I think the spiciness is perfect.  My hubby and I add some shredded cheese and a dollop of Greek yogurt to the top and it\u2019s an amazing dinner.  It freezes well, so we can eat it again without any work!

I did have to modify a couple of things so it wouldn\u2019t be spicy for my daughter.\nI only used 2 TBS of chili powder, no cayenne pepper at all, didn\u2019t use corn as we didn\u2019t have any and used 93% turkey as that was on hand. The flavor was great and this recipe was sooooooo easy! My hubby is picky with his chili and loved this. My daughter said she didn\u2019t like beans,  but loved this. I even sneaked some chopped mushrooms in for more fiber and nutrients. I think when j eat my portion,  I\u2019m going to throw in so chopped spinach too\u2026love my greens\u2026lol.

My husband is very chili picky and he gave it two thumbs up.  I like to make a batch and then freeze the leftovers in individual portions and either microwave or warm on the stovetop for a quick single meal or lunch at work.  If I\u2019m watching my calories I skip the sour cream, but it is a nice garnishment.

Since I have small kiddos, they only thing I changed is putting in 2 tblspns of chili powder instead of 4 so that it did not come out so spicy. They gobbled it up like they hadn\u2019t eaten in days!

Rave reviews from family and neighbors. Used Dutch Oven and  doubled the recipe except the beans, Used what was called for and added an additional can of black beans to the pot. For what it\u2019s worth \u2013 most people mentioned that it was the perfect amount of heat. Served with cast iron skillet corn bread and all the fixins. Super hearty and delicious!. The doubled recipe easily fed 8 adults and most had seconds. Thanks for sharing this recipe \u2013 it\u2019s a keeper!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nNina\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        October 6, 2020\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nGreetings from the UK\u2026. I have only just stumbled across your fabulous blog! I have just made the above chilli Wow\u2026  I \u2018tweeked\u2019 the recipe slightly as with the extra lockdown rules here I didn\u2019t have any sweet corn in the freezer or store cupboard. However, I had stashed away in the freezer a couple of organic chicken burgers which I defrosted overnight In refrigerator last night and decided I wasn\u2019t going to cook as burgers on BBQ as it\u2019s been raining heavy today. I made your recipe (halved the recipe) and broke the chicken burgers into pieces. I added a whole medium onion and 1 red pepper to compensate for no sweet corn. I added a couple of tablespoons of tomato pur\u00e9e to the chicken stock and a thumb nail piece of dark chocolate. I added 4 espresso size teaspoons of Calabrian chilli flakes (they are quite spicy) and all other spices as per your recipe. I cooked it in my Heston Sage Multi Cooker (I think there is an equivalent Breville one abroad) I cooked it on the Risotto setting for 12 minutes natural release. Absolutely perfect\u2026. thank you for your inspirational recipe\u2026.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-10-07 02:57:17WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 265855\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-10-06 21:57:17\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-10-07 02:57:17\n    [comment_content] => Hi Nina!

I don\u2019t eat beef, so finding this recipe has been life changing! My fiance (a beef eater) says he wayyyy prefers this over any \u201ctraditional\u201d beef chili too! I\u2019ve shared this recipe with dozens of people at this point and they all agree! it\u2019s incredible!\nI typically make it without the beans and would say 4 servings is probably a bit more accurate than 6.\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nGrace\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        October 11, 2020\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nThis is my go to chili recipe.  Well seasoned without being spicy.  And like any good chili, tastes better the next day as the flavors have more time to develop.\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nNancy\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        October 11, 2020\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nI like it much thicker so i let it simmer for about an hour and thirty minutes.

If you insist on beef based chili, this recipe using ground turkey will change your mind. Only changes I made: I did not have cayanne so I used 3/4 tsp of creole seasoning in place of cayanne and salt, replaced one can of kidney beans with black beans and omitted corn. Simmered for 40 minutes. Served with Mexican cheese mix and crumbled tortilla chips. Very flavorful and hearty. Will make again.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-10-15 21:54:49WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 267424\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-10-15 16:54:49\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-10-15 21:54:49\n    [comment_content] => Absolutely!

I use 3 tbsp chili pepper instead of 4 because we are a little wimpy with the heat. I also use 93% fat turkey and drain the fat. Then add the onion, pepper, and garlic to the turkey and saut\u00e9 it all together. Since the turkey pack I use is larger (20.8oz) I needed more tomato. I use a large diced tomato and 15 oz sauce instead of crushed. Thank you for sharing!

Instead of using two cans of kidney beans, I used one can of kidney beans and one can of black beans. I also used a higher fat content in the ground turkey. The chili had great flavor and I didn\u2019t think it was too spicy\u2026but I used a whole package of McCormick\u2018s chili seasoning, not powder. This will be my go-to chili recipe from now on!!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-10-30 22:39:37WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 270942\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-10-30 17:39:37\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-10-30 22:39:37\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

I made it in a crack pot. Cooked the onion, bell pepper, and garlic together and threw that in with the other ingredients, then cooked the turkey in the same pan as the veggies and threw that in the crock pot. I also did not rinse the corn or beans (because I didn\u2019t read lol) and it still turned out good! Used 3 tbsp of Walmart brand chili powder and it was a really good level of spiciness!

I didn\u2019t have as much Chili powder as the recipe called for, so I added extra Cayenne pepper and some paprika. I used crushed tomatoes rather than diced and I think that lead to a soup-ier consistency after simmering for 45 minutes. To thicken up the Chili, I whisked a tablespoon of flour and water together and added it as a thickening agent- that did the trick! 10/10 would recommend this recipe and will definitely be making it again.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-10-30 22:11:01WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 270890\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-10-30 17:11:01\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-10-30 22:11:01\n    [comment_content] => So happy to hear that!

We had a very small dinner party last night consisting of experienced foodies. Total of six people and of course,  we were responsible and socially distant.  Our group meets on a regular basis and are candid about the food being served.  Every person said, \u201cthis is the best chili\u201d; and this is a hard group to please!  The only change I made was adding a tablespoon of cocoa powder.  Other recipes called for cocoa powder so I threw it in.  Not sure how much of a difference it made. I made it on the stove in a La Crueuset pot then reheated in an Insta-pot.  I did have a different brand of chili powder spice but did not want to take a chance and bought the McCormick brand.  I was curious and did a visual and taste test and by far the McCormick brand was superior to the expensive brand I had on the shelf.  Thank you very much for this fabulous recipe.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-11-03 14:58:13WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 271394\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-11-03 08:58:13\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-11-03 14:58:13\n    [comment_content] => Amazing!

I put one teaspoon and my whole pot of chili was ruined.  Could not delude the hotness, but I will make it again. Other than that it would had been really good. After checking the recipe again it said only one forth teaspoon my fault. It should be noted the pepper can be to hot. I can\u2019t eat spicy foods.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-11-23 18:20:58WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 274637\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-11-23 12:20:58\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-11-23 18:20:58\n    [comment_content] => Sorry to hear that, Sherry!

I also used frozen sweet corn, because I knew the corn was good sweet corn, I\u2019ve had problems in the past with canned corn.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-12-03 03:38:08WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 279268\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-12-02 21:38:08\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-12-03 03:38:08\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

Glad I read the note section about different brand Chilli Powders. I used the whole foods one and started with 2 TBSP \u2013 it was insanely spicy! I ended up adding another 1/4 cup of chicken broth and 16 oz of tomato sauce to tame it. I\u2019ll have to try the McCormicks one next time. Great recipe, will make again!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nembalaje\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        December 15, 2020\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nThanks For Sharing This I Am Gonna Try This\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-12-16 02:36:41WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 282002\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-12-15 20:36:41\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-12-16 02:36:41\n    [comment_content] => Enjoy!\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/87.0.4280.88 Safari/537.36\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 281910\n    [user_id] => 1\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Monique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        December 15, 2020\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Enjoy!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMonique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        December 15, 2020\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Enjoy!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nLisa\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        December 16, 2020\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nI am not a fan of chili but I made this for company and it was a hit! I only used 2.5 tablespoons of the chili powder I had (not McCormick\u2019s Chili Powder) and my guests still said it was on the verge of being too spicy (but they ate it all so it must not have been too spicy to eat!!).  I am really glad that I read the note about the amount of chili powder before using 4 tablespoons of the one I had.\nI will definitely use this recipe again when chili is on the menu.  Thank you for all of the great recipes!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-12-29 04:24:02WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 285163\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-12-28 22:24:02\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-12-29 04:24:02\n    [comment_content] => I'm glad everyone liked it!

I always double it and save half since it freezes so well! I only make a few modifications \u2013 I dice up 3-4 stalks of celery along that get saut\u00e9ed along with onions and bell peppers, and sometimes switch it up and do half turkey/half lean beef. Ground turkey can be a bit bland, so if I\u2019m using only turkey then I season the turkey with some S&P before adding it in. Awesome recipe!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-12-29 03:19:33WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 284991\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-12-28 21:19:33\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-12-29 03:19:33\n    [comment_content] => Amazing!

I have learned my lesson once and for all when one claims their recipe is \u201cthe best\u201d, nine out of ten times it is not.  Maybe you think it is, but to advertise it as such when people\u2019s personal tastes vary is a example of the cooks over-confidence.  I assume this is considered healthy because it uses turkey instead of ground beef.  There are umpteen turkey chili recipes and I have made many over four decades, this one is the absolute worst.  Made exactly as written, only change was doubling recipe.  I cringed at the amount of chili powder as another poster mentioned so instead of 8 TBS total (ridiculous), I added 6 TBS.  There is no reason to have that much chili powder, it absolutely overwhelmed all other ingredients.  And I don\u2019t buy the \u201cmild\u201d chili powder note.  It\u2019s quite frustrating to invest in ingredients and time to make a dish with one ingredient so far beyond what other chili recipes call for.  I fell for it because of the positive reviews, so I question their validity.  Seriously, this recipe is mediocre at best.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2020-12-28 01:36:48WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 284749\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2020-12-27 19:36:48\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2020-12-28 01:36:48\n    [comment_content] => Sorry to hear that, Claire!

Im not a big ground turkey fan, but it really works with  these ingredients.  What I really love is how well it stands overnight, which by the way really blends the flavors to magnificence, without that coagulation of fat you get with ground beef.\nI substituted one can of red beans with a can of black beans.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2021-01-12 02:34:41WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 287306\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2021-01-11 20:34:41\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2021-01-12 02:34:41\n    [comment_content] => Absolutely!

It\u2019s definitely a journey\u2026 \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb. I tried this recipe but threw in a small sweet potato, some northern beans, Italian seasoning, and ancho chili powder, and wow. I also made it in the instant pot (saut\u00e9ed the turkey onion garlic and pepper, threw in everything else, and pressurized for 10 minutes). It was DELICIOUS!

It was a chilly gray Sunday and I decided to make a double batch to have leftovers and give to some of my hardworking teacher friends. The seasoning was great. I opted for crushed tomatoes for a little less chunks.  Also  I doubled all the ingredients except for the chili powder (used 4 tbsp of McCormick) since I wanted a milder flavor for kids.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2021-01-26 00:01:12WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 289688\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2021-01-25 18:01:12\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2021-01-26 00:01:12\n    [comment_content] => So glad you found this one!

I double the amount of ground Turkey. I also add some minced shallot and a can of tomato sauce.\nIn addition I find the chili to be a bit runny so so make a small amount of roux with flower and chicken broth and stir in at end to thicken.\nI also add a few 2 to 3 teaspoons of granulated sugar to taste. This takes the acid out of the tomatoes.\nIn addition to the suggested toppings, It is vey good served with cornbread or corn chips and salsa.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2021-02-09 23:05:10WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 293445\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2021-02-09 17:05:10\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2021-02-09 23:05:10\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

We\u2019re obsessed! It\u2019s filling, perfectly seasoned, and makes a ton so it\u2019s great for meals during the week. We make it in the instant pot and cut the broth down by 1/2 cup like the notes suggest! If we\u2019re feeling crazy we add a pinch more of cayenne and sweet potatoes to mix it up. If you want a healthy, simple, and filling meal, you NEED to try this recipe!!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nHaley\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        February 11, 2021\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nThis was amazing!

This turkey chili is amazing on its own, and extra cozy with cheese, green onion, and sour cream toppings (eaten while curled up with a blanket and watching Netflix).

I substituted pintos and black beans. And used Trader Joe\u2019s roasted corn(frozen). Added juice of two limes to add some bright notes. Found I needed about two cups of broth. Made  it for dinner tonight and got rave reviews. Some warm tortillas on the side. Super easy recipe! Yum!

It\u2019s fantastic \u2013 easy, healthy, and tasty! The corn really adds a fantastic texture boost (may even add 2 tins next time, but that\u2019s just my personal preference), so I would not leave this out. \nModifications: I was short on chili seasoning, so made my own, added one large carrot v the red pepper, a bit of jalapeno, and about 1/2 \u2013 3/4 tblsp molasses for extra depth. \nThis was also my second Ambitious Kitchen recipe of the day, as for brekkie, I treated myself to the Healthy Oatmeal Banana Pancakes \u2013 again, quick, healthier, and yum!

It is really just fabulous! I sometimes use chicken from a rotisserie instead of turkey. And sometimes swap one can of dark red kidney beans for 1 can of black bean (so one can of dark red and 1 can of bb total). I use \u201cregular\u201d chili powder and I do cut it down a little per the recipe.

The second time I changed a few thing, I omitted the cayenne pepper, because it was too spicy, I used frozen sweet corn, and because I was out of canned tomatoes I used a jar of Newman\u2019s Mild Salsa. I also seasoned the Turkey at about mid point.

I\u2019ve used variations, leaving out peppers if I don\u2019t have on hand, adding a few extra dashes of spices, even substituting garlic powder for garlic.  It\u2019s just a hit!

This is by far my favorite chili recipe. I cook the veggies and brown the meat and then throw everything in to the crockpot. Perfect quick meal! The spice is likely coming from the cayenne.. not the chili powder. I love the kick but if you can\u2019t handle the heat, knock the cayenne back or omit completely.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2021-03-10 15:51:45WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 301630\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 205.178.102.17\n    [comment_date] => 2021-03-10 09:51:45\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2021-03-10 15:51:45\n    [comment_content] => So happy to hear that!

I added 1 lb. of turkey extra, only 3 tbsp. of chili powder 2 tsp of Italian seasoning (I didn\u2019t have oregano), 1 onion, 1 red pepper, 3 cloves of garlic, 2-3 tap. olive oil, 1 can corn, 2 cans of kidney beans, double the cumin, cayenne pepper, and chicken broth.

First time followed recipe but left out bell pepper (sensitivity). After that I follow the recipe but sub bell pepper with diced celery and diced jalape\u00f1o and leave out the corn.

I never really learned/liked to cook. I move in with my bf during the pandemic. This is the first recipe I found that I use almost weekly. Still trying to memorize without looking. We never have chicken broth so I don\u2019t add that, but it still comes out delicious. I showed it to my family who also have no time to cook. \nI use 4 tablespoons of chili powder from ShopRite and it\u2019s perfect! We love putting avocado and Tobasco sauce mixed with the rice and chili.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2021-07-15 18:05:40WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 339603\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 76.93.192.132\n    [comment_date] => 2021-07-15 13:05:40\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2021-07-15 18:05:40\n    [comment_content] => I'm so happy you're loving it, Kelly!!

I cut back, as recommended, on the Chili Powder to 2 Tabs, but I used Chipolte Chili.  Also, I am not a big fan of beans, so I just put extra frozen Organic Corn.  I topped the serving dishes with Cheddar Cheese and Guacamole!

So filling and comforting on a cool day. It is so flavorful and chuck-full of deliciousness.

It was easy to make. I substituted chicken for turkey\u2026 Whole Foods was out of ground turkey. I used 3 tablespoons of chili powder, Simply Organic brand. It was  the perfect amount of heat for me. I loved the crunch the sweet corn gave it.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2021-08-16 16:06:31WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 345864\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 209.6.225.61\n    [comment_date] => 2021-08-16 11:06:31\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2021-08-16 16:06:31\n    [comment_content] => Hahaha sorry to hear that but glad you loved it!!

I also used 6 cloves of garlic (can\u2019t have too much garlic), 1 can of kidney beans, subbed in a sweet potato, and added a jalapeno (no seeds).  It turned out wonderfully!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2021-08-27 17:54:57WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 347837\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:197:c80:42d0:e52d:b2d7:2dcf:ef78\n    [comment_date] => 2021-08-27 12:54:57\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2021-08-27 17:54:57\n    [comment_content] => I'm so glad to hear you loved it, Malia!

This truly is the best chili \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t taste heavy like a lot of chili recipes do. Often I just make it all in the crockpot as a one pot meal, and serve with tortilla chips, cheese, jalape\u00f1o, tomatoes, and avocado. Amazing meal prep or freezer prep too, and with pantry items you have laying around.

Amazing recipe, exceeded all of my expectations. I followed the recipe with a few personal tweaks and turned out great! For the readers who stated their chili was soup like, DO NOT simmer with top on and be sure to drain beans and corn if using canned corn.\nMy added Tweaks: I added 1 tablespoon of sugar, ~1-2 tablespoons of bar b q sauce, 1/4-1/2 smoked paprika,  1/2teaspoon black pepper and 1/4-1/2 cup of water. I used  fresh corn on the cob and chucked it instead of canned corned and I used black beans instead of kidney beans.  Lastly, seasoned my ground turkey with season all, black pepper, and a bit of salt to ensure flavor in my meat.\nNote**I don\u2019t think the recipe needed any of my tweaks to taste great, that was just my preference based on how I usually cook.\nAgain, recipe is absolutely amazing, keeper indeed!\nThank you for sharing!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2021-09-13 18:49:53WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 350219\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 209.6.225.61\n    [comment_date] => 2021-09-13 13:49:53\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2021-09-13 18:49:53\n    [comment_content] => Thanks so much for the review and for sharing all of this!

I did not have any diced nor crushed tomatoes, so I used the couple cans of tomato sauce that I had on hand \u2013 and that worked just fine.  I did not have a can of corn, but I found in my freezer a bag of frozen sweet corn, and dumped that in.  For the garnish, I used what was in the fridge \u2013 a dollop of plain Greek yogurt.  I sprinkled atop that some dried cilantro that I found in my cupboard.  Thank you SO much for sharing this tasty chili recipe!  Next time I will get the exact ingredients on your list to prepare it with.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2021-09-17 18:06:31WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 351068\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 209.6.225.61\n    [comment_date] => 2021-09-17 13:06:31\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2021-09-17 18:06:31\n    [comment_content] => So happy to hear that all worked out well and that you loved it!

I decided to make it just based off the picture and to my surprise it looks exactly like the picture and it tastes just like I imagined it too. I think it\u2019s fantastic. The spice is not too spicy (I used spice Islands chili powder), and I thought it was fantastic! This is seriously going down in my book of favorites! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I ate my chili with half an avocado diced, and a crusty piece of ciabatta bread dipped in it.

Also, did you see notes for crock pot instructions. I reduced chicken broth as recommended. I gotta agree, it's not spicy, but definitely flavorful. I can't make it spicy because my daughter has a low tolerance for spice. If I made it for myself, I'd chop up a jalape\u00f1o and maybe add a bit more cayenne pepper, probably use a spicier chili powder as well. I did it for 7 hours on low, was perfect. 3 hours on high I don't think would be enough time to blend the flavors enough.\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 11; SM-S515DL) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/101.0.4951.41 Mobile Safari/537.36\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 353215\n    [user_id] => 0\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [404815] => WP_Comment Object\n                (\n                    [comment_ID] => 404815\n                    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n                    [comment_author] => Monique\n                    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n                    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n                    [comment_author_IP] => 209.6.225.61\n                    [comment_date] => 2022-05-12 09:52:28\n                    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-05-12 14:52:28\n                    [comment_content] => Thanks so much for sharing, Michael.

I love this recipe & highly recommend it. Not only was it delicious but the prep and overall process was really easy! I love that this chili is hearty and high protein. The only changes I made were no cayenne pepper because I didn\u2019t have it & I used frozen corn cooked in the microwave for 3 mins prior to adding to chili.

I\u2019m 36,my kids are 6, and 3. I can\u2019t get my kids to try anything new. So this time I just told them it was chili. They ate it, then 3 bowls later I told them what it was. They were so surprised.  It was soo delicious.  I will highly recommend this. I didn\u2019t follow the amounts of spices.  Just bc I used 3 lbs of meat then it called for.

I doubled the recipe,  used 2 red bell peppers, 1 and 1/2 onions and for tomatoes I used a 24oz can of crushed tomatoes, and a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes, 2 cans of kidney beans, 1 can of corn, about 2 cups of broth and I doubled the spices but only used 6 tablespoons of chili powder, and 2 lbs of turkey.\nIt turned out perfect.

In addition to the red pepper,  I added a few varieties of peppers I had in the freezer from the summer. I used crushed tomatoes because I like the consistency. I served the chili with the recommended toppings. I did not use tortilla chips as my husband wanted oyster crackers.

I used kidney and black beans. I used tomato sauce 8 oz to replace one can of tomatoes. This is the best chili I ever remember  eating. I didn\u2019t need any additional salt. The turkey was 99% fat free ground turkey breast.

Instead of doing the onions first, I cooked the spices in oil in my iron skillet for several seconds, then added the turkey and mixed the spices into that. I added some avocado oil and cooked that mixture till it was good and brown, then added the onion and cooked those down, then the garlic. I added a mad hatter bell pepper someone had given me fresh from their garden. Then the chicken broth, then crushed tomatoes. Finally I added half a habanero and some extra garlic for good measure.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2021-11-05 21:02:00WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 363254\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 209.6.225.61\n    [comment_date] => 2021-11-05 16:02:00\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2021-11-05 21:02:00\n    [comment_content] => Thanks so much for sharing, that all sounds delicious :) I'm so happy you loved it!\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/95.0.4638.54 Safari/537.36\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 363148\n    [user_id] => 1\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Monique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        November 5, 2021\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Thanks so much for sharing, that all sounds delicious \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m so happy you loved it!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMonique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        November 5, 2021\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Thanks so much for sharing, that all sounds delicious \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m so happy you loved it!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nJaneth Serrano\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        November 6, 2021\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nSeriously delicious and healthy!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nLaurie Giftochristos\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        November 7, 2021\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nAbsolutely delicious!

Lacks spice and depth usually found in chili. That said, it\u2019s very customizable! I would recommend adding some more chili powder. I added ancho chili pur\u00e9e and some smoked paprika. A splash of apple cider vinegar or some hot sauce was also recommended by my guests .

I only had one can of red beans so I had A can of black beans on hand and added it. I Added 1 Tbs of a diced jalapeno & a dash of Worcestire. One fault of my own is that my chili powder isn\u2019t fresh. It\u2019s been in the cupboard for at least 3 months and I truly Feel the spices have to be fresh for chili so next time, I will Do that. Easy recipe though and thank you for providing. I would Make it again just with fresh chili powder. I also Did 3 TBS instead of the 4.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2021-11-12 16:58:00WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 364069\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 68.9.186.114\n    [comment_date] => 2021-11-12 10:58:00\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2021-11-12 16:58:00\n    [comment_content] => Glad to hear you enjoyed it!

An important note: If you use 4 tablespoons of straight chili powder your finished product is going to be SPICY.  Like, really spicy.  So make sure to check the ingredients of whichever spice you\u2019re about to use.  If it\u2019s straight chili peppers and you don\u2019t want tears streaming down your face, don\u2019t use anywhere close to 4 tablespoons!  I made a double batch of this recipe and used only 3 tablespoons of pure chili powder, which resulted in a chili that is, for us, perfectly spicy.  If I\u2019d used 8 tablespoons, it would have been inedible.  If what you\u2019re using is chili peppers mixed with other things such as cumin, paprika, and garlic (which is what McCormick\u2019s chili powder is) you can follow the recipe as written and it will be delicious!  Serve with cornbread for a perfect winter dinner.\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nJeanelle\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        November 13, 2021\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nWe love this recipe and make it often!  An important note: McCormick\u2019s chili powder is peppers mixed with cumin, oregano, garlic and salt so if that\u2019s what you\u2019re using, 4 tablespoons is fine.  However, if your chili powder is 100% chili peppers, your finished product is going to be SPICY.  Like, burn your mouth and send tears streaming down your face spicy.  So check your chili powder\u2019s ingredients before measuring 4 tablespoons!!  I made a double batch and used 3 tablespoons of pure chili powder \u2013 it was perfectly spicy for us but 8 tablespoons would have landed our otherwise delicious chili in the trash.  So just be careful and measure according to which kind of chili powder you have in the kitchen!  Very tasty recipe!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2021-11-15 16:37:31WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 364417\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 209.6.225.61\n    [comment_date] => 2021-11-15 10:37:31\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2021-11-15 16:37:31\n    [comment_content] => Thanks so much for sharing, Jeanelle!!\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/95.0.4638.54 Safari/537.36\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 364196\n    [user_id] => 1\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Monique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        November 15, 2021\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Thanks so much for sharing, Jeanelle!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMonique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        November 15, 2021\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Thanks so much for sharing, Jeanelle!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nAlisa\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        November 14, 2021\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Corn is not paleo or whole 30 because it is a grain and high in sugar.\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nAlisa\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        November 14, 2021\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Beans, sour cream, tortilla chips and cheese are not whole 30 or paleo either.\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nRachel\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        November 14, 2021\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nSuch a delicious and flavorful chili recipe, and simple to make!

I make as written except I use Mexi corn and use the entire can juice and all. I saut\u00e9 the onion peppers and garlic, cook the turkey and dump everything into the crockpot and let it slow cook all day. The house smells amazing And the kids know when they walk in the door after school to the delicious aroma that mommy loves them!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2021-12-06 21:11:59WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 371636\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 209.6.225.61\n    [comment_date] => 2021-12-06 15:11:59\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2021-12-06 21:11:59\n    [comment_content] => Nice!!

Thank you so much for this treasure of a recipe. We have it at least twice a month.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2021-12-13 20:47:51WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 372768\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 209.6.225.61\n    [comment_date] => 2021-12-13 14:47:51\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2021-12-13 20:47:51\n    [comment_content] => Those are great subs!

I know it says to only do a half cup of chicken broth if making this in a crockpot but should I put in what the regular amount is?\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2021-12-30 14:43:23WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 386571\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 209.6.225.61\n    [comment_date] => 2021-12-30 08:43:23\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2021-12-30 14:43:23\n    [comment_content] => Hi!

The flavor was good and I liked the chili but it was disappointed since it was so spicy I couldn\u2019t even eat it. Waste of food and I love spicy food, this was over the top. And yes I did see the notes about using McCormick and doing less.

I used 3 tablespoons of McCormick type chili powder and only 1/8th teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Spice changes depend on your tolerance for heat. To me, these spice modifications were just right. I also used lean, rather than extra lean ground turkey. Chili did have a little more liquid than usual, but I like chili to be a bit soupy, rather than too dry. Adding a bit less chicken broth might help with those that felt it was too watery. Like that this recipe makes enough to enjoy the next day.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2022-01-10 22:13:46WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 387881\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 209.6.225.61\n    [comment_date] => 2022-01-10 16:13:46\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-01-10 22:13:46\n    [comment_content] => So glad you enjoyed it, and these modifications are great!\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/96.0.4664.110 Safari/537.36\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 387625\n    [user_id] => 1\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Monique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 10, 2022\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    So glad you enjoyed it, and these modifications are great!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMonique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 10, 2022\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    So glad you enjoyed it, and these modifications are great!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nBrogan\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 10, 2022\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nBest turkey chili I\u2019ve ever eaten! Modifications \u2013 I used 1.5 cups frozen corn instead of canned, used a bag of frozen peppers/onions instead of fresh, and added only 1T of chili powder and a sprinkle of cayenne because I\u2019m a spice wimp. Served with shredded cheese and nonfat Greek yogurt \u2013 so good!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2022-01-13 20:59:03WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 388227\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 209.6.225.61\n    [comment_date] => 2022-01-13 14:59:03\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-01-13 20:59:03\n    [comment_content] => Nice!

I make this at least once a month and always double it so we can have plenty left over.  I\u2019ve used fresh tomatoes a couple times and substituted black beans for kidney beans. I always add a bag of frozen butternut squash or sweet potatoes in place of the frozen corn.  The last time I made this, I added a half cup of canned pumpkin since I didn\u2019t have any squash or sweet potato.  This chili is always a hit.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2022-01-17 16:50:39WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 388750\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 70.181.14.250\n    [comment_date] => 2022-01-17 10:50:39\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-01-17 16:50:39\n    [comment_content] => Nice!

It was fast and easy. My husband can\u2019t eat onion or peppers so I had to leave it out and I added fire-roasted corn instead of plain.\nIt is thick, hearty and delicious even without the onion and peppers. I served it homemade cornbread. I will definitely keep the recipe and make it again.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2022-01-17 16:33:18WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 388723\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 70.181.14.250\n    [comment_date] => 2022-01-17 10:33:18\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-01-17 16:33:18\n    [comment_content] => Oh I'm so glad it still tasted amazing without those!

Also I added my bell peppers in about 20 mins from the end because I like more firmness to my bell peppers in chili.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2022-01-18 16:35:43WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 388912\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 70.181.14.250\n    [comment_date] => 2022-01-18 10:35:43\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-01-18 16:35:43\n    [comment_content] => So glad you loved it, Chelsea!

Also cooked it longer because I was doing other things, but my husband loved it and he usually does not like ground Turkey or anything heathy.

This has become a staple for my fiance and I. I found this recipe at the beginning of the pandemic when we first moved in and I didn\u2019t have a clue how to cook. This came up and it is so delicious and packed with protein! We leave out any cheese, cream, or corn. We do add the 4 tablespoons of chili powder and add in some tobasco sauce to our individual plates as well as avocado! Delicious and so easy!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2022-01-27 19:20:50WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 390109\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 209.6.225.61\n    [comment_date] => 2022-01-27 13:20:50\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-01-27 19:20:50\n    [comment_content] => Omg I LOVE THIS!

I struggle with reflux, and find spicy food is a trigger, so did decrease the spices by about 1/4, although I\u2019m not sure I needed to.  Definitely followed advice and used McCormick Chili Powder. This came together quickly, and the spice combo was delicious.

We love it spicy, so I add an additional cumin, chili powder and cayenne. My daughter can\u2019t have corn, so we eliminate it. I sometimes use a red onion in the chili in place of a yellow onion, and will mix up the beans in terms of cannelloni, kidney, black beans. I know it changes the nutritional content but it adds an nice change.

I used all 4 tablespoons of chili powder and I did think it was a tad spicy for me. However it was very flavorful and tasty and the spice was not an issue to where I couldn\u2019t enjoy it. If you\u2019re someone who has a low spice tolerance I would say to do less tablespoons as she suggested.

Good to know that it is also crock-pot friendly. I added a couple dashes of Worchestershire sauce. I did not have any cayenne pepper so I diced up a jalapeno pepper instead. I also used 4 Tblsp McCormac Chili Pepper and both my husband and I found the hear to be just right! I need to get some cayenne pepper for my next batch though. Will review again after I make a second batch.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2022-02-14 20:37:47WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 392462\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 209.6.225.61\n    [comment_date] => 2022-02-14 14:37:47\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-02-14 20:37:47\n    [comment_content] => Nice!

I make it every time it snows. It is so warm and comforting on cold, snowy days. The only thing that I change is that I don\u2019t add the corn.\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nAlaina\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        March 14, 2022\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nI\u2019ve made this recipe so many times and have my own modifications along the way but it\u2019s so good as written, this has become a favorite at my house. My sons asks for it often. I cut back to 3 tablespoons chili powder and halved the cayenne but I added a poblano, two jalape\u00f1os and about two cups finely shredded carrots and some honey.

When my husband sees healthy in the recipe he asks but is it good? Yes it was! great blend of flavors with the right amount of heat! I am trying to clear out my pantry so I substituted one can of kidney beans with chickpeas. We just sprinkled some cheddar on top and it was very satisfying.   thanks for the recipe!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2022-03-22 16:01:31WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 397206\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 209.6.225.61\n    [comment_date] => 2022-03-22 11:01:31\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-03-22 16:01:31\n    [comment_content] => Haha healthy doesn't have to mean bland or boring!

It was early spring & hot out today and I was worried it was the wrong day for Chili. However this Chili combined with the Honey Pumpkin Cornbread muffins was the perfect way to say good bye to winter. So delicious. The only things I did differently were because I was lacking a couple ingredients. I did chili pinto beans and kidney beans and no corn. I used crushed tomatoes. I had to use \u2018chicken bullion\u2019 for broth and an orange bell pepper. I just realized I used a tablespoon cumin in error. I don\u2019t handle super spicy and it was just perfect heat.  It was so yummy and filling. The muffin went perfectly.

Used spices exactly as specified but added chopped carrot and could see kale, riced cauliflower  peas, or see sweet potatoe or other root veg being added if you want to leave meat out.  An easy,quick and tasty recipe.

We\u2019ve mae it three times in about two months, and I\u2019m about to prepare it again for tonight\u2019s supper.  It is very good!

Regarding chili powder, we buy ours from a South Asian grocery store, and we know that it\u2019s VERY HOT.  We adjusted the amount in this recipe to just half a teaspoon, because we know how spicy our chili power is.

Made this recipe for my husband who is a self-proclaimed Chili Aficionado and the 5-star rating is his.  I used 3 tbsp of chili powder and it wasn\u2019t too spicy at all.  The only substitution was diced carrots for the corn as I had some in the fridge that needed using up.

Especially since I have dietary restrictions that don\u2019t allow most meats that go into chili. I think the combination of ingredients was good and enjoyed how straight-forward the instructions were. Though I  experimented with it a bit. Threw in kale and butternut squash instead of corn. I think it\u2019s funny that there was a note about people commenting that it was *too* spicy because I think it could have had more of a kick. Even with 4 tablespoons of chili powder and extra cayenne, it wasn\u2019t really spicy at all. BUT that could totally be my spices losing strength or maybe I\u2019m just used to things being so hot, my mouth tingles. Anyway, great recipe!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2022-09-15 20:11:30WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 424106\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2600:4040:5238:1700:51ba:d034:90c7:ce79\n    [comment_date] => 2022-09-15 15:11:30\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-09-15 20:11:30\n    [comment_content] => That all sounds great!!

I used only 2 tbsp of chili powder instead of 4 & unsalted beef stock instead of chicken broth. I cut up a jalape\u00f1o (no seeds) and added a green pepper instead of red.

You are my go-to recipe queen. I cook for a group of 6-8 grown men every week, and a tripled pot of this chili is simmering on the stove right now for them + plenty of leftovers for my hubby and I.

Let me tell you, he ate almost the entire pot of this! I am amazed at the flavor of this recipe. I often find chili bland and boring but THIS!! I followed the recipe exactly and it was incredible.

I am not a fan of corn so I left that out. I also don\u2019t love the flavor of cumin so I did half the listed amount. I am pretty sensitive to spice and did the listed values and thought it was super flavorful but not spicy. Otherwise followed recipe and wouldn\u2019t make any changes! Cooked on my stovetop in a big pot, super easy to make:)\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2022-11-10 14:49:28WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 432652\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:151:8300:284:ec05:8996:2dbe:f542\n    [comment_date] => 2022-11-10 08:49:28\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-11-10 14:49:28\n    [comment_content] => Ahh this is amazing!

It was quick and easy to make.  Just my kind of cooking.  I didn\u2019t expect too much but was blown away with the recipe.  Hearty with great flavors.   I ate half the first day.  I froze the rest which wasn\u2019t the best move as I ate it in the following days.  I\u2019ve made it again and am down to one serving.  Looks like a trip to the grocery store. Delicious and recommended. FOR SOME READON I CANT GIVE FIVE STARS.

Add the spices, beans, tomatoes, and chicken stock and cook on high pressure for 15 minutes and, voila!, dinner is made \u2013 all in one pot!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2022-12-05 22:36:52WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 435116\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:151:8300:284:54bd:8876:536e:aaec\n    [comment_date] => 2022-12-05 16:36:52\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-12-05 22:36:52\n    [comment_content] => Love this!

Absolutely incredible! Followed the directions pretty exactly \u2013 we used bulk barn chili powder, still 4tbs as we like things spicy. Also threw in a zucchini going off in the fridge. Smells incredible & the spoonfuls we sample from the slow cooker are amazing. Can\u2019t wait for a full bowl with some avocado!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2022-12-07 19:44:05WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 435349\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:151:8300:284:8c3a:7941:4683:ed85\n    [comment_date] => 2022-12-07 13:44:05\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-12-07 19:44:05\n    [comment_content] => Oh yes!

We overdid ground Turkey over the last few years so we swapped it for ground chicken since they have the same consistency and lean meat health benefits.\nWe also found the first batch too spicy (although it was amazing), we reduced the chili powder to 2 tbsp (Costco Chili powder) and the cayenne pepper to 1/8 tsp. We also added a dash of worshestershire sauce. Chef\u2019s kiss!!!

I made the recipe exactly as it is written and it was perfect! I didn\u2019t think it was too spicy but I was wondering if maybe some people have a sensitivity to any amount of cayenne. Whenever I make any recipes with any cayenne about half of my family will be telling me it\u2019s too spicy but the other half can\u2019t taste the spice.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2022-12-20 17:04:47WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 437140\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 98.206.102.161\n    [comment_date] => 2022-12-20 11:04:47\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-12-20 17:04:47\n    [comment_content] => So glad you loved this one!

I leave out the corn and beans to keep it low carb and it\u2019s still delicious. I also leave out the broth because I find that it\u2019s usually thin enough if I cook it in my Dutch oven with the lid on to retain the moisture. We also top ours with a lot of cilantro. Sooo delicious!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2022-12-26 15:50:44WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 437646\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 71.171.118.252\n    [comment_date] => 2022-12-26 09:50:44\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2022-12-26 15:50:44\n    [comment_content] => Yum, this sounds absolutely delicious.

Spices are spot on (it\u2019s definitely got heat that stays with you but we love that) and it cooked super easily. \nI made two changes: subbed a can of garbanzo beans for the corn and added a few sprinkles of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg with the seasonings. Thanks to another poster here for the idea! \nTopped with shredded cheddar, lite sour cream, and cilantro and it\u2019s seriously good! \nI was hesitant because I personally like beef chili over turkey chili but this recipe is going to be a staple all winter long, thank you!!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nClaire Grossman\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 16, 2023\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nJust made this recipe with ground chicken instead of turkey and love it so much!

So simple and so good.  It\u2019s easily one of our \u201cfamily\u201d recipes now.  My husband is a hunter and we\u2019ve made it with elk in place of turkey, and it\u2019s equally amazing.  I love it plain, but sometimes we go full-on taco soup style with Fritos, sour cream (or Greek yogurt), and cheese.  It\u2019s always a hit.  And it\u2019s the only food we\u2019ll actually eat the leftovers of for days without getting tired of it.  I go back-and-forth on the crushed versus petite diced tomatoes.

I used mostly ground chicken with some ground beef, and subbed beef broth for the chicken broth (a little more than called for, because I wanted it to be soupier when reheated). Also added some Slap Ya Mama seasoning, and subbed fire roasted diced tomatoes for regular. So delicious!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2023-02-14 02:47:42WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 442727\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:151:8300:284:1ddc:237b:eafa:e462\n    [comment_date] => 2023-02-13 20:47:42\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2023-02-14 02:47:42\n    [comment_content] => Yum, sounds delicious.

I even only did 3 tablespoons of the chili powder. It for sure only needed 1/2 if even. Not sure how to save this I already added many cups of milk and greek yogurt. Really disappointed I wasted all this money.\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nBailey Potts\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        February 22, 2023\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nThe best turkey chili EVER!

Just made it last night for the family and it was a hit. We ate the chili with Trader Joe Organic Corn Chip Dippers \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc8b\nAs far as the chili powder, I used half the amount suggested and it was perfect. Keep in mind that you have to let all the flavors come together during the simmering process. The spice level will calm down a bit.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2023-03-02 19:32:47WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 444688\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:151:8300:284:91a1:d935:2a0f:2882\n    [comment_date] => 2023-03-02 13:32:47\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2023-03-02 19:32:47\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

Using ground turkey breast, this is just about WW point free.  It\u2019s just delicious without any mods.  As in any chili or stew, I like to let it simmer for a few hours on a very low heat.  I usually serve it with some chopped chipotles in my bowl, since my wife doesn\u2019t like it too spicy. A winner!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2023-03-13 23:44:13WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 446067\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:151:8300:284:8ef:ebe7:d6d:ec70\n    [comment_date] => 2023-03-13 18:44:13\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2023-03-13 23:44:13\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

I followed the recipe without much modification \u2013 just did a double batch. Since it was a large amount I cooked the peppers in a skillet first and then cooked the turkey in the skillet (x2) before putting everything in the pot.

Only 1 WW point.\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nJeffrey\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        March 26, 2023\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nI make a batch of this chili every 4 to 6 weeks and the family loves it. I would suggest only 1/8 tsp of cayenne, 1/2 tsp it calls for is too much and tends to drunk a the other flavors.\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nSean Ingber\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        March 26, 2023\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nMade this tonight and it was so good!

I have so many chili recipes, but this one is my new favorite. I found it flavorful and balanced as far as seasonings, and the turkey was surprisingly tender. After reading the notes, I went with 2.5 Tbsp chili powder since mine was not McCormick brand, and that\u2019s what I have put in other chilis with good results. This chili can stand on its own, but tortilla chips, shredded cheese and avocado slices all tasted yummy!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nAubrey Sammoms\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        April 19, 2023\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nI omitted the oil and threw it all in a crockpot.

It came out excellent. My daughter loves it. I have made it multiple times on request! I did spice it up a bit more with some jalape\u00f1o pepper, but without it the chili still has a decent heat to it. Serving it over rice really stretches it out too! I\u2019ve passed this recipe on to others who made it and approved as well! Very good recipe. It\u2019s a keeper.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2023-06-28 16:12:38WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 453832\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2600:1700:68a4:4580:d425:b787:babd:917b\n    [comment_date] => 2023-06-28 11:12:38\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2023-06-28 16:12:38\n    [comment_content] => I'm SO glad that you all love it!

It was easy and quick to make. When I make beef chili, I usually add 2 teaspoons of chili powder, which is just what my family can handle. So I was surprised at the suggested 4 tablespoons. I tried 1 tablespoon instead. However, perhaps because there were other spices used also, we found this to be too little. Next time I\u2019ll try 2 tablespoons. I tried 3/4 teaspoons of salt and we felt it needed more. I\u2019ll try 1 teaspoon next time. The consistency was more like soup than chili, a little watery, so I added a mixture of 2 tablespoons cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water to thicken it for the last 10-15 minutes of simmering.\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nAnonymous\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        August 21, 2023\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nMade this tonight and loved it!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2023-08-22 16:42:30WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 461855\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:147:4680:25f2:898b:35e8:99a9:3454\n    [comment_date] => 2023-08-22 11:42:30\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2023-08-22 16:42:30\n    [comment_content] => YAY!

I couldn\u2019t find chili powder in Spain so accidentally purchased hot paprika. It was fine if one note but the dish had some heat. As far as deviations or ad libbing, I liberally doused Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce. I also added a can of tomato paste to try to thicken the broth. At dinner we served with grated cheddar cheese and hand crushed tortilla chips. \nThe following day, I made basmati rice and we ate leftovers over the rice with generous dollops of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. If anyone struggles on the cook, don\u2019t worry because this recipe is foolproof for the next day. You will eat like a king especially if you add cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Bon app\u00e9tit.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2023-08-30 17:02:50WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 463294\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:147:4680:25f2:64df:8d34:6511:74a0\n    [comment_date] => 2023-08-30 12:02:50\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2023-08-30 17:02:50\n    [comment_content] => AMAZING!

Also this was my first time making chilli  with lean ground Turkey meat and I realize I prefer ground beef.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2023-09-04 21:29:45WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 464314\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:147:4680:25f2:65ba:bdc7:1e88:9eb8\n    [comment_date] => 2023-09-04 16:29:45\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2023-09-04 21:29:45\n    [comment_content] => Hi Krystyna - Thanks so much for your feedback, I appreciate it!\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/16.6 Safari/605.1.15\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 463719\n    [user_id] => 1\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Monique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        September 4, 2023\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Hi Krystyna \u2013 Thanks so much for your feedback, I appreciate it!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMonique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        September 4, 2023\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Hi Krystyna \u2013 Thanks so much for your feedback, I appreciate it!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMariah\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        September 4, 2023\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nThis is the best chili, I stumbled upon this a few years ago and have made it dozens of times since.

Followed the recipe exactly, but forgot to add the corn. I might cut back a little on the chili powder I used next time (Aldi brand), but it was great and a hit even with my accidental omission. Especially yummy with cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips. Great recipe with lots of wiggle room to add veggies or spice level to fit preferences!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2023-09-16 19:36:40WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 466462\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:147:4680:25f2:1573:e042:1e0a:24f5\n    [comment_date] => 2023-09-16 14:36:40\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2023-09-16 19:36:40\n    [comment_content] => Sounds amazing!

I\u2019m not a fan of kidney beans and can\u2019t eat corn, so the recommendations that worked with black beans, garbanzo beans, small white beans\u2026very helpful!  I do love hot food, but will take the recommendation of getting the McCormick chili powder when making it for the first time, then adjust the heat as needed the next time.

Based on other reviews, I dropped the chili powder to 2 TBS, and it was still very hot (and I enjoy hot).  After tasting it (making it as written, with the exception of replacing 1 can of kidney beans with black beans \u2013 because it is what I had on hand), I did add just a bit of Worcestershire, and a bit of honey to tone down the heat.  Without any of the \u201cextras\u201d it was still very flavorful.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2023-10-17 15:54:03WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 471836\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:147:4680:25f2:7cb5:d1d:ebeb:ce16\n    [comment_date] => 2023-10-17 10:54:03\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2023-10-17 15:54:03\n    [comment_content] => Amazing!

Shocked people say it\u2019s too spicy. I used spicy chili powder and 2 jalapenos and the spice level is medium-low. Add some yogurt or sour cream to tone down the heat. Also I would suggest doubling the protein and keeping everything else basically the same, Just enough liquid to keep it stewy!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2023-10-24 19:13:59WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 473461\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 69.143.120.49\n    [comment_date] => 2023-10-24 14:13:59\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2023-10-24 19:13:59\n    [comment_content] => PERFECT!

I was nervous about it being to spicy like some had said, so I bought the McCormick Chili Powder like you had stated above and it was perfect. I added the full 4 Tbsps. and it wasn\u2019t too spicy at all.

We regularly double and triple it to freeze many extra servings and reheat whenever needed. My husband always requests this when I ask what he wants for dinner. We make it vegetarian/vegan using Morningstar farms grillers crumbles in place of the ground meat, and veggie broth instead of chicken broth. Otherwise I\u2019ve got this recipe totally memorized as is!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2023-11-07 14:25:28WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 476791\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:147:4600:557:1c24:9919:2c34:4fd9\n    [comment_date] => 2023-11-07 08:25:28\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2023-11-07 14:25:28\n    [comment_content] => YUM!

I think its too much Cumin.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2023-11-20 17:20:31WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 479387\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:147:4600:557:246d:572c:75aa:32c9\n    [comment_date] => 2023-11-20 11:20:31\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2023-11-20 17:20:31\n    [comment_content] => What brand chili powder did you use?\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/16.6 Safari/605.1.15\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 479367\n    [user_id] => 1\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Monique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        November 20, 2023\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    What brand chili powder did you use?\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMonique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        November 20, 2023\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    What brand chili powder did you use?\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nKasha\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        November 20, 2023\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nDidn\u2019t have a red pepper on hand, sadly, so added a touch of raw sugar for the slight sweet.

The flavours and texture were all perfection! It was so easy to prepare as well, which I always love. It was a hearty meal that my whole family enjoyed (even my littles who were hesitant at first). I did not have any sweet corn, so I chopped up some carrots and cooked them first before the peppers and onions to be sure they would be soft. I also used one can of black beans and one can of red kidney beans. I topped it with avocado and hot sauce (even though it didn\u2019t need it. I just love hot sauce!) and enjoyed it with some blue corn chips. Kids had plain greek yogurt and cheese on top of theirs too.

I used a little less chili powder, and I think next time, I will use about 2.5 tbsp of chili powder and amp up the cumin a bit.  We also added some black beans in place of one of the cans of kidney beans.  I\u2019m not sure that made a difference \u2014 it was just what we had in the pantry.  Served with shredded pepper jack cheese, sour cream, and corn bread,\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2024-01-29 19:34:27WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 504665\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 73.8.26.228\n    [comment_date] => 2024-01-29 13:34:27\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2024-01-29 19:34:27\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

My doctor put me on a low sodium diet, so I started looking for a new recipe and came across yours. It really is the best! My husband told me how good it was several times during the meal. Since he is the only one that likes things spicy, I put less chili powder than the recipe called for and left out the cayenne pepper. It worked for everyone else, and he just added some hot sauce to his bowl to suit his taste. I will definitely make this again.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2024-02-05 22:38:25WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 507040\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:240:cb01:9020:a806:da7e:bdd6:2a5a\n    [comment_date] => 2024-02-05 16:38:25\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2024-02-05 22:38:25\n    [comment_content] => Amazing!

Change the recipe to make it vegan. Soy based hamburger instead of turkey and vegetable broth instead of chicken. I also added a can of black beans. The give the chili a more interesting look.

Everyone love it!  The first to try it was one of the kids at the party who declared, \u2018this chili smells so good, where are the bowls?!\u2019 My 6 year old daughter asked me to make it again (this never happens!). Parents asked for the recipe. I followed it to a T per the slow cooker notes, but I did keep the chicken broth to the same amount as the original recipe 1.5 cups as it was looking a little dry mid cooking. Thank you Monique for an easy, delicious and nutritious recipe!

I\u2019ve made it twice \u2013 once in the slow cooker and once on the stovetop. Both are great, but the slow cooker option is amazing! I think it develops more flavor by slow cooking. It kind of sounds silly to follow a recipe for chili because it seems like such a basic/easy thing to make, but something about this recipe is spot on. The spice and flavor are just right.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2024-02-15 21:14:06WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 512404\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:240:cb01:9020:bc12:d1b:bd9a:aa8b\n    [comment_date] => 2024-02-15 15:14:06\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2024-02-15 21:14:06\n    [comment_content] => So good!

EASY. A CROWD PLEASER. I have made this recipe, so so so many times.  Like, it is my go to every time that I make my family turkey chili. I have even transcribed it into personal recipe book (credit is given of course \ud83d\ude09 ), so whenever I pass it down to my kids someday, it will literally be Monique\u2019s turkey recipe hahaha. This recipe is very loved in our home!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2024-02-15 20:50:32WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 512352\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:240:cb01:9020:bc12:d1b:bd9a:aa8b\n    [comment_date] => 2024-02-15 14:50:32\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2024-02-15 20:50:32\n    [comment_content] => So happy to hear that!

I\u2019m so glad that I followed Monique\u2019s recipe because it\u2019s so tassty and has the right balance of heat and spice. I think I needed more salt, but that\u2019s typical for me. I also used ground beef because that\u2019s what I had on hand.

I top it with plain Greek yogurt and a few slices of avocado and throw it over rice or quinoa if I want a heartier meal. 10/10\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2024-02-21 15:44:20WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 514849\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:240:cb01:9020:4d1d:cef1:f8ac:c7d9\n    [comment_date] => 2024-02-21 09:44:20\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2024-02-21 15:44:20\n    [comment_content] => So glad it's a favorite!!\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/121.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 514790\n    [user_id] => 1\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Monique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        February 21, 2024\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    So glad it\u2019s a favorite!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMonique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        February 21, 2024\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    So glad it\u2019s a favorite!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nNatalie\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        February 20, 2024\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nThis chili recipe is SO good!

I didn\u2019t have all of the ingredients on hand so used ground chicken, one can of Rotel tomatoes and peppers for half of the tomatoes, pinto beans instead of kidney beans, and frozen roasted corn instead of a can of sweet corn.  Turned out great and topped with cilantro, avocado, low fat sour cream and reduced shredded Mexican cheese blend along with a few corn chips on top.  Have plenty left for more meals.  Will be making this again soon.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2024-03-22 20:15:18WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 516215\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 73.8.26.228\n    [comment_date] => 2024-03-22 15:15:18\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2024-03-22 20:15:18\n    [comment_content] => This one's super versatile!

And, it sure is  spicy! My husband said this was better than any restaurant he has ever eaten chilli in. I basically followed the recipe to a \u201cT\u201d. I didn\u2019t need to add any other ingredients to \u201ccorrect\u201d the chilli and the end at all either! Just perfect!

The longer food is left at these temps, the more unhealthy it is!

I followed the recipe with an addition of a can of Chili starter ( tomatoes, green chilis, cumin and chili powder ) ,  We like a bit spicy so I also added a de-seeded jalape\u00f1o.  The family loved it so much I\u2019ve made it the same way now at least three times, and we\u2019ll be having it tonight!   Serve it with a side of cornbread or even for chili dogs..\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2024-05-07 15:24:47WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 518249\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:240:cb01:9020:4567:f7a0:ca96:8348\n    [comment_date] => 2024-05-07 10:24:47\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2024-05-07 15:24:47\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

I ended up using double the beans (one can of red kidney and one can of pinto). I also used the pre-made spicy chili seasoning mix and then added extra garlic and onion powder. I also threw some jalape\u00f1os in there to make it a twinge more spicy. I\u2019m going to eat this with cottage cheese as a substitute for sour cream and with some garlic knots. Amazing recipe, thanks!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2024-06-07 14:36:53WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 519248\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:240:e380:60b0:c112:fe3e:310b:a2ba\n    [comment_date] => 2024-06-07 09:36:53\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2024-06-07 14:36:53\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

I\u2019ll finish it with a nob of cold butter and a small squeeze of lemon juice too.

I was reluctant since I LOVE ground beef but trying to eat healthier.  This was awesome.  I like extra mild so probably go with 3 T chili powder next time.  I use McCormick and this was great, but maybe a little milder for me.

I use beef, pork any meat I have and just change the broth.  The spices are perfect but I have never used the oregano as it just sounds wrong.

This is our new favorite chili recipe. I did make a few tweaks. I first cooked the onion until starting to brown (for 7 min), then I added 3 chopped Roma tomatoes (instead of canned tomatoes), and cooked down for another 3 minutes over medium high heat or so. This step forms a paste and wonderful deep flavor. I then added bell pepper, chopped zucchini, garlic, spices, and cooked the remainder of the recipe (minus canned tomatoes) as instructed. I use Simply Organic Chili powder and used 3 tbsp. The seasoning blend was absolute perfection. I did reduce the corn to about a half cup, since I had added a whole zucchini. We enjoyed it served over rice with cheddar, green onions, avocado, and tortilla chips. I don\u2019t know if I could ever make another chili recipe again. This is a keeper!! Thank you! Your soup recipes are always next level, Monique!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2024-07-17 18:38:39WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 520501\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 71.201.93.55\n    [comment_date] => 2024-07-17 13:38:39\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2024-07-17 18:38:39\n    [comment_content] => Amazing!

I was skeptical about a turkey chili but this exceeded all expectations and then some! So flavorful, perfectly balanced, protein packed, and delicious!! I doubled the bell pepper to get some more veggies in there and also did a combo of beans and a combo of chili powders. I did regular chili powder, Kashmiri chili powder, and a little smoked paprika and paprika to tone down the spice for littles. 10/10 will be adding to our weekly rotation!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2024-11-12 16:23:31WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 524600\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 71.201.93.55\n    [comment_date] => 2024-11-12 10:23:31\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2024-11-12 16:23:31\n    [comment_content] => Amazing!

In place of the plain diced tomatoes I used Del Monte\u2019s zesty chili style tomatoes. In place of the kidney beans I used pinto beans. And girl, because I do like spicy, I used a full teaspoon of cayenne. I also omitted the corn since it really has no nutritional value.\nHave to say I really did enjoy it\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2024-11-20 19:41:06WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 524910\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:240:e380:60b0:4510:4bd3:8076:7496\n    [comment_date] => 2024-11-20 13:41:06\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2024-11-20 19:41:06\n    [comment_content] => Love it!

Omitted cayenne pepper and used 2 tbsp. Chili powder. Instead of stock used turkey gravy and vegetable water. Had no onion so used chopped green onions. Topped with asiago cheese and Que Pasa organic carnival corn chips. Very, very tasty. Will definitely make it again.

Thank you for the recipe. I doubled it (used about 6 tblspns of chile powder) and ground chicken instead of ground Turkey. I will be making this all the time!! I also use pinto beans because they are almost creamy and blend into the dish. This is key for people who are not bean fans.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2025-01-06 22:11:48WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 526730\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 71.201.93.55\n    [comment_date] => 2025-01-06 16:11:48\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2025-01-06 22:11:48\n    [comment_content] => Love it!!\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 526676\n    [user_id] => 1\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Monique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 6, 2025\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Love it!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMonique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 6, 2025\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Love it!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nJudy Jones\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 5, 2025\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nReally, really good. Followed the recipe pretty much exactly except for a few swaps: yellow pepper instead of corn (cus that\u2019s what I had) and chickpeas and black beans in place of kidney beans (cus preference). Really impressed with how tasty this was. I\u2019ve made turkey chilli before and found it lacked depth of flavour but this one wasn\u2019t missing anything. I really enjoyed it and will definitely make it again.

It is so easy to make and delicious. I think the chicken broth really contributes to the flavor.  Because my family doesn\u2019t like spice, I only add two tablespoons of chili powder, and I use 93/7 turkey meat.  This chili also freezes very well so I always have some in stock.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2025-01-21 17:48:38WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 527353\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 71.201.93.55\n    [comment_date] => 2025-01-21 11:48:38\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2025-01-21 17:48:38\n    [comment_content] => So happy to hear that!\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 526942\n    [user_id] => 1\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Monique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 21, 2025\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    So happy to hear that!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMonique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 21, 2025\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    So happy to hear that!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nHolly\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 12, 2025\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nI haven\u2019t had much success with ground turkey, usually finding it pretty tasteless. Not this recipe. After dinner, my husband commented that if it was healthy, he\u2019d eat this instead of our usual chili with hamburger. High praise indeed. Doubled cayenne, squirt of ketchup to temper acid. Very good!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2025-01-21 17:45:20WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 527342\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 71.201.93.55\n    [comment_date] => 2025-01-21 11:45:20\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2025-01-21 17:45:20\n    [comment_content] => So happy to hear that!!\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 526958\n    [user_id] => 1\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Monique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 21, 2025\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    So happy to hear that!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMonique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 21, 2025\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    So happy to hear that!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nPeggy\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 13, 2025\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nMy husband and I loved this recipe\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2025-01-21 17:34:19WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 527309\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 71.201.93.55\n    [comment_date] => 2025-01-21 11:34:19\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2025-01-21 17:34:19\n    [comment_content] => I'm so glad!\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 526999\n    [user_id] => 1\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Monique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 21, 2025\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    I\u2019m so glad!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMonique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 21, 2025\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    I\u2019m so glad!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nKateski\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        January 16, 2025\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nThis is a WONDERFUL chili!

I discovered this recipe 2 years ago, and I have made it at least 25 times since then!  I have made it as meals for people after having a baby or surgery, and I have shared the recipe with others, too!  I make it as written, except that my husband and I do not like peppers, so I leave those out, but that does not leave it lacking in flavor.  I use all other ingreadients exactly as listed, but if I don\u2019t have 2 cans of kidney beans on hand, then I use one can of kidney beans, and one can of black beans.  We like topping the chili with a bit of sour cream, shredded cheese, avocado, and sometimes also use green onion and tortilla strips, and we serve it with either tortilla chips or cornbread,  I\u2019m so glad to have this thick, smoky Tex-Mex version of chili, and I love that it is made with ground turkey for a healthier option.  This is my go-to chili recipe!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2025-01-21 16:28:14WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 527208\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 71.201.93.55\n    [comment_date] => 2025-01-21 10:28:14\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2025-01-21 16:28:14\n    [comment_content] => Amazing!

It was a fine turkey chili, but it was not the best healthy turkey chili we\u2019ve ever had. We made the recipe as is to judge it on its own merit, but I believe that some of the suggestions made by other commenters would have helped. It is, however, a good base recipe to build off of.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2025-01-21 16:22:49WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 527203\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 71.201.93.55\n    [comment_date] => 2025-01-21 10:22:49\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2025-01-21 16:22:49\n    [comment_content] => I'm glad you gave it a try!

Added 1 large stalk of diced celery to the onion/bell pepper.  I did also omit one can of the kidney beans (because it looked like a nice amount with one) and I left out the can of corn.  If you want the extra fiber, the additional can of beans would be great too.  Followed the rest exactly.  Loved it.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2025-01-28 17:08:06WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 527757\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 71.201.93.55\n    [comment_date] => 2025-01-28 11:08:06\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2025-01-28 17:08:06\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

Swap the corn and beans for low/no sodium and actually use a  12 oz can of lager craft beer from our local brewery instead of the chicken stock. So yummy!

It\u2019s delicious fresh and it refrigerates well for meal prep. It has a great nutritional profile, especially when paired with a dollop of greek yogurt and a slice of avocado.\nThe two changes I make (to fit my personal preference, the original recipe is great!) is I use a can of black beans in addition to a can of kidney (as opposed to two cans of kidney), and I have a heavy hand with the chili powder to make it a bit spicier. \nThank you for sharing this recipe, I\u2019ve loved it for years!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2025-02-03 18:29:54WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 527964\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 71.201.93.55\n    [comment_date] => 2025-02-03 12:29:54\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2025-02-03 18:29:54\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

Sometimes I make it with ground beef (my favorite iteration), sometimes I make it vegetarian by adding black beans and sweet potato, or sometimes I do it exactly as directed like today.  It\u2019s so easy and filling! I also put it on a bratt and top with cheese sometimes to make it a cheese coney!\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2025-02-13 18:49:49WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 528334\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:240:e380:60b0:2cf1:af3c:180a:6bb9\n    [comment_date] => 2025-02-13 12:49:49\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2025-02-13 18:49:49\n    [comment_content] => Love that idea!!\n    [comment_karma] => 0\n    [comment_approved] => 1\n    [comment_agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/132.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\n    [comment_type] => comment\n    [comment_parent] => 528121\n    [user_id] => 1\n    [children:protected] => Array\n        (\n        )\n\n    [populated_children:protected] => 1\n    [post_fields:protected] => Array\n        (\n            [0] => post_author\n            [1] => post_date\n            [2] => post_date_gmt\n            [3] => post_content\n            [4] => post_title\n            [5] => post_excerpt\n            [6] => post_status\n            [7] => comment_status\n            [8] => ping_status\n            [9] => post_name\n            [10] => to_ping\n            [11] => pinged\n            [12] => post_modified\n            [13] => post_modified_gmt\n            [14] => post_content_filtered\n            [15] => post_parent\n            [16] => guid\n            [17] => menu_order\n            [18] => post_type\n            [19] => post_mime_type\n            [20] => comment_count\n        )\n\n)\n    \n        \n            \n        \n                \n\t\t                    Monique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        February 13, 2025\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Love that idea!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nMonique\n\t\t\t            \n\t    replied:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        February 13, 2025\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    Love that idea!!\n\t\n        \n        Reply\nAnonymous\n\t\t\t            \n\t    says:    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\t    \n\t        February 9, 2025\t    \n\n    \n\n\t\n    \nI come back to this recipe over and over.

I did make it twice once with crushed tomatoes and onces with diced and I must say it is quite a different texture turnout, the crushed one is more chili like but with that i had to use a bit of sugar to contrast the acidity. Also added celery to get more veggies in. Also I only used 2 tablespoons of chili powder.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2025-02-13 18:39:58WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 528307\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 71.201.93.55\n    [comment_date] => 2025-02-13 12:39:58\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2025-02-13 18:39:58\n    [comment_content] => Noted on the two types of tomatoes!

I dialed down the spice by reducing the cayenne; I see your note about chili powder, but that\u2019s not usually spicy regardless of the brand, whereas cayenne can vary greatly based on age and brand. I recently ran out of cayenne I\u2019d had for a while, since I only use it here and there, and was spiced out by one of my own recipes using the fresher powder; where 1/4tsp used to be the magic number, I\u2019m now using a scant pinch (less than 1/8tsp), and so that\u2019s what I used in this recipe and it was the perfect kick. I love the amount of chili powder used here and think that\u2019s a big  part of the flavor (most chili recipes use 1/2 or less than 1/2 this amount, and I always increase),\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2025-02-25 18:25:08WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 528820\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 98.193.88.41\n    [comment_date] => 2025-02-25 12:25:08\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2025-02-25 18:25:08\n    [comment_content] => Perfect!

I made this chili a few days ago and we ate it last night.  OMG!  It\u2019s delicious!  I always wait at least a day or two before eating a chili or soup so the flavors meld. But I couldn\u2019t wait and tasted it after I finished cooking and found it to be just MEH. So I was thrilled when hubby and I ate it last night and it was delish!  Followed the recipe to a T and am thrilled. Now I\u2019m looking through your blog for your next amazing recipe to surprise hubby and me.\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2025-03-18 16:13:44WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 529596\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 71.201.93.55\n    [comment_date] => 2025-03-18 11:13:44\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2025-03-18 16:13:44\n    [comment_content] => Amazing!

I\u2019ve tried twice, (the first time i did a double portion amount) and the calories came back completely different then the listed ones on the recipe both times sadly, any pointers you might have as I\u2019m using this as an awesome meal prep option during a calorie deficit\n\t\n        \n        Reply    \n        \n        \n    \n        2025-03-18 15:13:36WP_Comment Object\n(\n    [comment_ID] => 529477\n    [comment_post_ID] => 13988\n    [comment_author] => Monique\n    [comment_author_email] => ambitiouskitchen@gmail.com\n    [comment_author_url] => https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com\n    [comment_author_IP] => 2601:240:e380:60b0:395a:e7c0:52f9:399e\n    [comment_date] => 2025-03-18 10:13:36\n    [comment_date_gmt] => 2025-03-18 15:13:36\n    [comment_content] => Hi Stephen!

It was a great balance of ingredients, I\u2019ve used black beans since we had them in hand and only used 2 tablespoons of chilli powder and about 1/8 of a teaspoon of cayenne. My family is sensitive to heat and Our chilli powder was Definitely a mild one, if you ever get an imported Indian chilli powder, you may need to scale it back even more!\nMy son said it was the best Chilli he has ever had and asked for a second helping. He is only six but that\u2019s a pretty high compliment.

After adding some salt to the draining cucumber and letting is sit for 15 minutes I used the back of a spoon to press more water out and then flipped the sieve over onto some paper towel layers and patted more water out. There was no water puddling after sitting in the fridge for 5 hours. Everything Bagel seasoned Naan bread dippers, yes there is such a thing :) and they are perfect for the Tzatziki dip. Thank you Holly, many of your recipes are even simple enough for me to make. :)\n\nReply\nSpend With Pennies SP\nJanuary 5, 2024 at 10:41 am\n\nThank you so much for leaving a comment, Anne!

I\u2019ve made it about 5 times now. I would recommend using chicken thighs instead of breasts because they tend to hold moisture better on the grill. I marinate in a large freezer plastic baggie because it helps spread the marinade evenly through the chicken (esp if you squeeze out all of the air before zipping and lay it flat in the fridge). I also love adding in mushrooms! My wooden skewers keep catching on fire on the grill but no big issues. Overall, great recipe!!

With a sharp knife, cut shallow crosshatched incisions across top and bottom surfaces of steak. Rub spice mix all over surface of steak. (It's best to wear gloves as the chile powder is hot.) Place steak in a resealable freezer bag.\nStep 2\n\nIn a small bowl, whisk together lime juice and zest, \u00bc cup olive oil, the Worcestershire sauce and half the garlic. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the marinade and pour the rest into the bag with steak. Seal and move steak around in bag to coat thoroughly. Place on a sheet pan and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. Massage bag periodically to redistribute marinade. Refrigerate reserved marinade if cooking the next day.\nStep 3\n\nHeat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and cook, stirring, until they soften and begin to color, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in bell peppers and chile. Cook, stirring, until peppers begin to soften, about 3 minutes.\nStep 4\n\nLower heat to medium, add remaining garlic and cumin, and salt to taste. Cook, stirring often, until peppers are nicely seared, softened and beginning to caramelize, 5 to 8 minutes.\nStep 5\n\nPour in reserved 2 tablespoons marinade and scrape bottom of pan with a wooden spoon to deglaze. Stir in half the cilantro. Taste and adjust seasoning. Remove from heat but keep warm.\nStep 6\n\nWrap tortillas in foil and warm in a low oven, or wrap in a towel and warm in a steamer or in the microwave.\nStep 7\n\nHeat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, or prepare a medium-hot grill. Remove meat from marinade and discard marinade. Pat meat dry with paper towels. If using a skillet, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in skillet. (If your skillet is not large enough for the steak, cut it in half and cook in batches.) Cook for 3 to 4 minutes per side. Meat should be medium rare. Remove to a cutting board, cover with foil and let sit for 10 minutes. Cut across the grain into \u00bd- to \u00be-inch wide strips.\nStep 8\n\nArrange lettuce on a platter, then place steak next to lettuce. Tip juices from cutting board over meat and sprinkle with remaining cilantro. Serve vegetables on the same platter or separately, along with warm tortillas, salsa and crumbled queso fresco."

I know it says 640 calories, but how BIG is the service size for that amount? I\u2019m trying to count calories and such so I\u2019d definitely like to be able to log my meal and portion this correctly. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be exact but an estimate would still be nice, and it definitely is probably a ME not understanding what I\u2019m reading problem. Haha\n\nReply\nSpend With Pennies SN\nMarch 24, 2025 at 10:42 am\n\nHi Amber, I am glad you enjoyed this meal so much!

It\u2019s a huge hit here & will become a monthly meal. Thanks for a great recipe!\n\nReply\nDiana Fleury\nMarch 4, 2025 at 7:42 am\n\nThis was delicious. I used raw carrots and potatoes and put them in with the onions. When I shredded chicken, then did bisquick biscuits on top and continued cooking for another hour.\n\nReply\nJohn\nMarch 4, 2025 at 4:05 am\n\nI made this exactly as described and it was great. Everyone wanted seconds. Pro tip: lightly grind some croutons in your hand over each serving for a chicken pot-pie like result. Thanks for the recipe!\n\nReply\nTracey Mitchell\nMarch 2, 2025 at 10:08 am\n\nHello! I am making this today and am cooking it on low. How long will the biscuits take to cook on low, is it double the amount of time (2-3 hours)? Than you! I am excited to make this dish for my family.\n\nReply\nHolly Nilsson\nMarch 3, 2025 at 8:05 am\n\nI haven\u2019t tried cooking the biscuits on low.

I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and cooked the biscuits in the oven separately to avoid them getting mushy, especially for leftovers. It was delicious! Definitely in rotation for the cold weather months. Thanks again for an excellent recipe; your website is my go-to for family-friendly recipes.\n\nReply\nKate B\nFebruary 21, 2025 at 9:08 am\n\nThis is one of my families all time new favorite recipes. We are making this in our house about once a week for the last four months. We absolutely LOVE it. I do not follow the recipe 100% because I want as little dishes as possible and I like big carrot chunks. Changes I made: Onion and fresh carrot in the bottom, chicken on top, seasoning and parsley, soup and broth, then biscuits, quartered or torn into chunks, and placed on top of chicken. Cook on high for 5 hours. 10-15 minutes before serving toss in 1 cup frozen peas.\n\nReply\nSher\nFebruary 20, 2025 at 6:08 pm\n\nI made this recipe last night and I loved it! The only changes I made Is I used boneless skinless thighs. Plus, I added 3 cups chicken stock and cut my biscuits into 4 quarter\u2019s. It definitely takes an hour to fully cook biscuits to a golden brown. Thanks for this recipe!\n\nReply\nDeborah\nFebruary 19, 2025 at 4:35 pm\n\nTasty but biscuits were gooey and overall made dish taste starchy, I used buttermilk biscuits followed directions and cooked longer than 1 hour and it still turned out very gooey.\n\nReply\nHolly Nilsson\nFebruary 20, 2025 at 5:17 am\n\nIn this case the \u2018biscuits\u2019 are dumplings are are intended to both thicken the broth and be moist in texture.\n\nReply\nHolly Nilsson\nFebruary 20, 2025 at 5:17 am\n\nIn this case the \u2018biscuits\u2019 are dumplings are are intended to both thicken the broth and be moist in texture.\n\nReply\nAlexis\nFebruary 16, 2025 at 12:05 pm\n\nI just put this in the crockpot and love how easy the prep was.

Already looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!\nJENNIFER LAMKIN \u2014 JANUARY 26, 2022 @ 9:51 PM REPLY\n\nThis was delicious! \u00a0A big hit with the family.\nRUTH \u2014 FEBRUARY 16, 2022 @ 1:44 PM REPLY\n\nAmazing\nTARA \u2014 FEBRUARY 23, 2022 @ 7:12 PM REPLY\n\nQuick, easy & delicious! Definitely becoming a staple on our weekly menu!\nMELM \u2014 APRIL 14, 2022 @ 9:14 AM REPLY\n\nThis was amazing! I even made the homemade pitas and I felt like a gourmet chef! lol Never would have thought to make homemade pitas before. I made the whipped feta and tzatziki the day before. My food processor is kind of small so I never end up using it and just tried using my nutri-ninja for the whipped feta, but it was too thick. I ended up just using my electric mixer. It didn\u2019t get it as smooth as I would have liked, but it was still delicious. Meatballs were yummy too and my daughter ate them up. I doubled them, so looking forward to having more for lunch today.\nMARJI \u2014 JANUARY 29, 2023 @ 6:49 PM REPLY\n\nFabulous fun tasty crowd pleasing dinner! Flavors perfect. The chewy pitas were amazing. Loved the shippers feta and tzatziki too. Will be making this again!\nDEREK THE RED \u2014 APRIL 22, 2023 @ 2:14 PM REPLY\n\nWe make a lot of recipes and this was immediately one of our favorites ever. The final product is beautiful, delicious, and hearty.\n\nMy only tip is to not go *too* thin on the pita rollout. Ours ended up a little too big for a hand sandwich and not as fluffy as expected, though still soft and tasty.\n\nTo simplify we\u2019ll also be trying this same recipe but over brown rice and other hearty grains!\n\nThank you!\nKERI \u2014 JANUARY 15, 2024 @ 8:52 PM REPLY\n\nMeatballs instead of chicken breast is a welcomed twist on a pita. Everyone in my family kept stealing the meatballs before I could assemble these. I like the red pepper feta and to add a little spice I mixed in a spoonful of spicy bomba plus a bit of olive oil and lemon juice in order to get it to blend in my particular blender (my specific tool needs more liquid). I also added some pickled red onions,olives, and red pepper since I had some I needed to use up. I can see myself making this and other variations for a long time to come.\nHALLIE \u2014 FEBRUARY 4, 2024 @ 7:27 PM REPLY\n\nReally Good! \u00a0Even my oldest son ate the roasted red pepper whipped feta which was a major win :). I made the homemade pitas too and used my pasta maker to help me get the pitas super thin. I\u2019ll definitely make it again. Yum!"

If you have only a 24 oz jar, you can top up the extra 4oz with tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes.\n\nReply\nHolly Nilsson\nJanuary 26, 2025 at 8:39 am\n\nI use 28 oz, you can buy some jars that are larger than 24 oz.

I made some changes based on what I had in the kitchen, plus my vegetarian diet\u2026 it was gobbled up by my meat eating friends and family. I used a bag of frozen veggie crumbles instead of meat, and mascarpone+cottage cheese instead of ricotta which I didn\u2019t have. Will go into recipe rotation!\n\nReply\nAmy\nDecember 28, 2024 at 6:22 am\n\nThis baked ziti is a hit in my household! I use ground beef and add the minced garlic and extra Italian seasoning as recommended. I also use jarred prego sauce and omit the water added because I feel it\u2019s not necessary. Thank you Holly for another recipe to add to my rotation!\n\nReply\nJeannie\nDecember 25, 2024 at 4:18 pm\n\nLove this recipe. Make it for the grandkids When they visit. Does the parsley have to be fresh or can you substitute parsley flakes?\n\nReply\nHolly Nilsson\nDecember 26, 2024 at 6:21 am\n\nSo glad your grandkids enjoy this recipe! You can use parsley flakes, reduce it to 1 tablespoon.\n\nReply\nHolly Nilsson\nDecember 26, 2024 at 6:21 am\n\nSo glad your grandkids enjoy this recipe!

Cook until golden, 1-3 minutes. Pour in the broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the beans and kale. Season with salt and pepper. If you have one, add a parmesan rind. Simmer 8-10 minutes until the orzo is al dente, stirring often. It should become very creamy.\n2. Stir in the pesto, milk, parmesan, and lemon, cook another few minutes until warmed through.\n3. Divide the orzo and broth among bowls and add additional parmesan and black pepper.

I used spinach instead of kale as they didn\u2019t have any at the store & it was certainly a good substitute.\n\nREPLY\nTieghan\nApril 1, 2025 at 6:40 PM\n\nThanks so much, Julie!!

Only modifications I usually make are to use 2x dried beans and halve the orzo. And yes, you\u2019ll likely want to add extra broth to leftovers as the orzo will soak up liquid, no big deal.\n\nREPLY\nTieghan\nApril 1, 2025 at 6:36 PM\n\nHey Lindsay,\nHappy Tuesday!!

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "content": "Source: https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/baked-potato/\n\nIngredients:\nINGREDIENTS\nSCALE\n1x\n2x\n3x\n1 medium-to-large Russet potato, scrubbed clean of any dirt\n1\u20132 teaspoons melted butter (or olive oil)\npinch of coarse Kosher salt\npinch of freshly-cracked black pepper\nCook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\nINGREDIENTS\nSCALE\n1x\n2x\n3x\nINGREDIENTS\n1 medium-to-large Russet potato, scrubbed clean of any dirt\n1\u20132 teaspoons melted butter (or olive oil)\npinch of coarse Kosher salt\npinch of freshly-cracked black pepper\n\nInstructions:\nHeat oven to 450\u00b0F. Yep, you read the temperature right. The oven needs to be extra hot, so that the potato skins will crisp up quickly.\nPrepare your baking sheet.\u00a0 If you happen to own a wire cooling rack, I highly recommend placing one on top of a baking sheet, so that the potatoes can cook evenly on all sides. Or if you don\u2019t own a wire rack, you can either place the potatoes directly on the oven racks (with a baking sheet below, to catch any drips) or you can just bake the potatoes on a foil-lined (or parchment-lined, at your own risk) baking sheet.\nPoke your potato all over with a fork.\u00a0 Because no one wants to deal with exploding potatoes. ;)\nFirst bake. My best advice for how long to bake a potato \u2014 in two rounds! For the first round, bake for about 25 minutes, until the skin starts to feel dry and slightly wrinkly.\nBrush the potato with melted butter (or oil). Next, carefully remove the potato from the oven. Use a pastry brush to brush the potato with melted butter (or oil) evenly on all sides. Sprinkle the potato with a generous pinch of Kosher salt. (I like mine fairly coarse so that you get a bit of a crunch.)\u00a0 Then place the potato back on the baking sheet, opposite side up, so that the potato can cook evenly on both sides.\nSecond bake. Bake for an additional 20 minutes. Then very carefully, use an oven mitt to squeeze the potato (it will be hot) to check for doneness. If the insides are nice and soft and give under pressure, remove the potato from the oven. Otherwise, continue cooking in 5-minute increments until the potato is ready to go. Cooking time will vary depending on the size of the potatoes, but on average, they typically take 45-55 minutes to cook.\nCut, squeeze, fluff, season and serve! Finally, slice the potato open lengthwise with a paring knife, give it a good squeeze to open it up, fluff the insides with a fork, add your favorite seasonings or toppings.

    "content": "Source: https://www.loveandlemons.com/pasta-salad/\n\nIngredients:\nEasy Pasta Salad\n\nThis fresh, easy pasta salad recipe comes together in under 30 minutes! Tossed in a tangy vinaigrette and filled with veggies, it's a cookout hit.\n\nSUMMER / SALADS \u2014 JUMP TO RECIPE\n\nToday\u2019s recipe is a picnic-perfect pasta salad! Every cookout needs a great pasta salad, and this is the one that I make all summer long. It comes together in no time, it\u2019s full of fresh ingredients, and it packs a flavorful punch.\n\nI took extra care to make sure that this recipe is not just easy, but also easy to make in advance\u2026 because I totally get that you don\u2019t want to be futzing with your pasta salad when you could be spending time outside with your friends.\n\nNote: If you do decide to make this salad in advance, toss on some whole basil leaves before serving to make it instantly prettier.\n\nPasta Salad Ingredients\n\nThis classic pasta salad recipe is easy and fresh. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to make it:\n\nFusilli pasta \u2013 Or your pasta of choice! Short pasta shapes are best here. I like rotini, penne, and farfalle in addition to fusilli.\nCherry tomatoes \u2013 I love their sweet flavor and juicy texture in this salad.\nCucumbers \u2013 For crunch! I like to use Persian cucumbers or English cucumber here. Both have very thin skins, so there\u2019s no need to peel them.\nChickpeas \u2013 They add plant-based protein.\nArugula \u2013 It adds peppery flavor and extra green.\nFeta cheese \u2013 For salty, tangy flavor.\nPine nuts \u2013 Like the cucumbers, they add satisfying crunch.\nAnd fresh herbs \u2013 Parsley, basil, AND mint pack this salad with fresh flavor!\n\nFind the complete recipe with measurements below.\n\nPASTA SALAD DRESSING\n\nA simple pasta salad dressing takes this recipe over the top. It\u2019s a zesty mix of olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, garlic, red pepper flakes, and salt. I finish it with a pinch of herbes de Provence. Italian seasoning works nicely too!\n\nI love this quick homemade dressing, but it\u2019s not your only option here. Try tossing this salad with Italian dressing or a red wine vinegar Greek salad dressing\u00a0instead!\n\nHow to Make Pasta Salad\n\nMaking this recipe is a breeze! Just follow these simple steps:\n\nCook your pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water. Drain it, toss it with some olive oil, and set it aside to cool.\nChop your cherry tomatoes and cucumbers, mince the parsley, and crumble the feta.\nWhisk together the dressing ingredients.\nAnd toss everything together in a big bowl! Season to taste and dig in.\n\nMy Best Pasta Salad Tips\nCook your pasta a little longer than normal. It should be a tad past al dente (but not mushy) so that the pasta stays soft when it cools. I find that the higher time range listed on the package instructions is usually just about right for cold pasta salad.\nLet your pasta cool completely before tossing it with the other ingredients.\u00a0If it\u2019s still warm, the hot pasta will start to cook and wilt the vegetables. No one\u2019s a fan of warm cucumber, so make sure you\u2019re tossing cold pasta into this dish.\nTaste and adjust. Like most salad recipes, this one is super flexible, so be sure to taste and adjust it to your liking before serving. Add more lemon if you prefer a tangier salad, toss in more greens if you\u2019re all about the veggies, and always, always salt to taste.\n\nRecipe Variations\n\nThis pasta salad is fantastic as-is, but feel free to change it up to match your tastes or the ingredients in your pantry. Here are a few suggestions:\n\nMake it vegan. Use olives or sun dried tomatoes in place of the feta.\nMake it gluten-free.\u00a0Use gluten-free pasta or quinoa in place of traditional noodles.\nGo Greek. To make this recipe more of a Greek pasta salad, add 1/2 cup each of kalamata or black olives, diced bell pepper, and thinly sliced red onion.\nTry a Caprese combo. Use halved mini mozzarella balls in place of the feta.\nTry another herb. Fresh oregano would be lovely in place of the mint in this salad, and thyme would also be a great addition.\nSwap out the arugula for spinach, or leave it out altogether if you prefer a higher pasta: veggie ratio.\nOr roast your chickpeas for extra crunch.\nHOW TO STORE AND MAKE AHEAD\n\nThis pasta salad recipe is a great side dish to make ahead for picnics, potlucks, and cookouts. I recommend making it up to a day ahead of a gathering. Leftovers keep well in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.\n\nIf you make this salad ahead,\u00a0wait to add half the herbs and pine nuts until right before serving. The herbs will retain their vibrant color and the pine nuts will keep their crunch. Toss them into the salad and season to taste with more salt and lemon juice before digging in.\n\nMore Favorite Summer Salads\n\nIf you love this pasta salad recipe, try one of these delicious summer salads next:\n\nBest Broccoli Salad\nWatermelon Salad\nCucumber Salad\nCreamy Coleslaw\nBest Potato Salad\nGreek Salad\nOr any of these 51 Best Salad Recipes!\n\nGet This Recipe In Your Inbox\nShare your email, and we'll send it straight to your inbox.

I cooked the meatballs in my air fryer in 2 batches. 385 for 15 \u2013 20 min. That probably depends on how big the meat balls are \u2013 I did my smallest cookie scoop. I made a fresh Tzakiki sauce and served sauce and meatballs in a lettuce leaf. I made the dressing and added garbanzo beans to make a nice side salad. So healthy and so tasty!\n\nREPLY\nTieghan\nJuly 26, 2024 at 6:16 AM\n\nHey Jackie,\nHappy Friday!! So glad to hear that this recipe turned out nicely for you, thanks for making it and your feedback!

Due to lack of any type of fat in the meatballs they were super dry. No amount of tzatziki is going to help that. I should have known using chicken with recipe as is wouldn\u2019t come out well.\n\nREPLY\nTieghan\nJuly 5, 2023 at 8:08 AM\n\nHi there,\nThanks for trying this recipe and sharing your feedback, sorry to hear it was not enjoyed.

You need to use your common sense when following a recipe. You cannot just go by the letter of the recipe, especially if you are in another country, using a different cut of beef etc. I used beef brisket, and it took 4 hours on my stove top. The positive of this was I did not have to reduce the sauce down. Beef will shred when it is ready to shred. Use the given ingredients in the recipe yes, but as far as cooking times etc these can vary greatly. The end result was exceptional. My only change was adding chilli flakes as we like our food with a little kick. Also made Nagi\u2019s focaccia. If you have not made this, you need to. It is another level.\n\nREPLY\nLauren\n\nNOVEMBER 24, 2024 AT 7:15 PM\n\nI was expecting to love this dish after reading the comments. My husband and I found this was was a little underwhelming. The 5 year old loved it though, winner with him. Love every other recipe I\u2019ve cooked of Nagi\u2019s\n\nREPLY\nPam\n\nNOVEMBER 19, 2024 AT 4:05 AM\n\nI made exactly as written but made the sauce the day before and reduced it just before serving, adding a pinch of sugar and a little more salt. I didn\u2019t have high hopes of this recipe being anything special because there were no special or unusual ingredients. I worried because thyme seemed to replace typical Italian herbs. I tossed the pappardelle a good 2 minutes and I must say this was utterly delicious and different from spaghetti sauce in a good way. My husband commented multiple times how good it was, including many hours later. Exceptional flavor from simple ingredients and easy to prepare !\n\nREPLY\nbianca\n\nNOVEMBER 18, 2024 AT 3:30 PM\n\nWow \u2013 Amazing.

They still tasted great but were no longer crisp but soft!\n\nREPLY\nTieghan\nMarch 1, 2024 at 11:37 AM\n\nHi Helen,\nThanks so much of trying this recipe and your feedback!

Followed the recipe almost exactly \u2014 used sour cream rather than yogurt and thighs rather than breasts and we loved it. I used your Tahini recipe and made tzatziki and naan from scratch \u2014 so many fabulous flavors at once while you are eating. My four grown daughters and I just love your cookbooks/recipes! Thank you!\n\nREPLY\nTieghan\nMarch 30, 2025 at 6:55 AM\n\nHey Patti,\nHappy Sunday!!

I made the chicken and had it on homemade yogurt flatbread with the lettuce, pickled red onion and Tzatiki. I did make the Tahini but enjoying what I have in front of me so much that I\u2019ll have to go for the Tahini on my next round. This chicken is absolutely one of the best things I have ever tasted in my life!\n\nREPLY\nTieghan\nApril 2, 2025 at 6:17 AM\n\nThank you so much, Lynn:) Love to hear this!!\n\nREPLY\nTieghan\nMarch 30, 2025 at 6:55 AM\n\nHey Patti,\nHappy Sunday!!

I use Trader Joe\u2019s vegan tzatziki, vegan feta and omit the yogurt in the marinade because I am temporarily dairy free and it is a delicious recipe. I cannot wait until I can have dairy again, I just know I\u2019ll be even more obsessed with this dish!\n\nREPLY\nTieghan\nMarch 1, 2025 at 6:21 AM\n\nHey Laura,\nWonderful!

Do you think brands of tahini vary? Is that the culprit? Thoughts on how to add flavor/interest to it? More of everything else?\n\nREPLY\nTieghan\nJanuary 28, 2025 at 3:37 PM\n\nHi Brietta,\nOh no! So sorry to hear this! I guess it could be the tahini, I\u2019m not sure what else it would be. Unless you had a bad lemon? I really love Whole Foods 365 brand tahini if you have access to that. I hope this helps! xT\n\nREPLY\nTieghan\nJanuary 28, 2025 at 3:37 PM\n\nHi Brietta,\nOh no! So sorry to hear this! I guess it could be the tahini, I\u2019m not sure what else it would be.
